<p>Summary : An introduction to the brain&#8217;s anatomical organization and functions with explanations in terms of evolutionary adaptations and development.This introduction to the structure of the central nervous system demonstrates that the best way to learn how the brain is put together is to understand something about why. It explains why the brain is put together as it is by describing basic functions and key aspects of its evolution and development. This approach makes the structure of the brain and spinal cord more comprehensible as well as more interesting and memorable. The book offers a detailed outline of the neuroanatomy of vertebrates, especially mammals, that equips students for further explorations of the field.Gaining familiarity with neuroanatomy requires multiple exposures to the material with many incremental additions and reviews. Thus the early chapters of this book tell the story of the brain&#8217;s origins in a first run-through of the entire system; this is followed by other such </p>

<p>Summary : A LEGENDARY FAMILY  ?  For generations, the descendants of the powerful telepath known as The Rowan have used their talents to benefit humanity. As human civilization reached out to colonize the stars, the family led Earth to ally itself with the peaceful alien Mrdini. Together, the two races have held back the predatory Hivers, who once decimated entire worlds.  ?  THE NEW ORDER  ?  But there are factions on Earth who resent the power the family has accumulated. Now, with their goals of peace and prosperity so close at hand, The Rowan?s descendants face the looming destruction of all they have suffered to achieve? </p>

<p>Summary : 7 hrs and 38 minsLucas Thorn wasn?t born a cheater. All it took was a single moment?say, a certain disastrous incident on the night before his wedding?and boom. Reputation destroyed forever and always. So now he owns it. He has a lady friend for every night of the week (except Sundays?God?s day and all), and his rules are simple: No commitments. No exceptions.But a certain smart-mouthed, strawberry blonde vixen is about to blow that all to hell.Avery Black has never forgiven Lucas for cheating on her sister. And suddenly being forced to work with him is pretty much a nightmare on steroids. Of course, it does afford her the opportunity to make his life as difficult as possible. But no good revenge scheme comes without payback. Because he didn?t become the Lucas Thorn without learning a few things about women.Now Avery?s lust for vengeance has turned into, well, lust. And if Lucas stops cheating, it?s definitely not because he?s falling in love?</p>

<p>Summary : 7 hrs and 38 minsLucas Thorn wasn?t born a cheater. All it took was a single moment?say, a certain disastrous incident on the night before his wedding?and boom. Reputation destroyed forever and always. So now he owns it. He has a lady friend for every night of the week (except Sundays?God?s day and all), and his rules are simple: No commitments. No exceptions.But a certain smart-mouthed, strawberry blonde vixen is about to blow that all to hell.Avery Black has never forgiven Lucas for cheating on her sister. And suddenly being forced to work with him is pretty much a nightmare on steroids. Of course, it does afford her the opportunity to make his life as difficult as possible. But no good revenge scheme comes without payback. Because he didn?t become the Lucas Thorn without learning a few things about women.Now Avery?s lust for vengeance has turned into, well, lust. And if Lucas stops cheating, it?s definitely not because he?s falling in love?</p>

<p>Summary : H?l?ne has been inexplicably ostracized by the girls who were once her friends. Her school life is full of whispers and lies ? H?l?ne weighs 216; she smells like BO. Her loving mother is too tired to be any help. Fortunately, H?l?ne has one consolation, Charlotte Bronte?s Jane Eyre. H?l?ne identifies strongly with Jane?s tribulations, and when she is lost in the pages of this wonderful book, she is able to ignore her tormentors. But when H?l?ne is humiliated on a class trip in front of her entire grade, she needs more than a fictional character to allow her to see herself as a person deserving of laughter and friendship.Leaving the outcasts? tent one night, H?l?ne encounters a fox, a beautiful creature with whom she shares a moment of connection. But when Suzanne Lipsky frightens the fox away, insisting that it must be rabid, H?l?ne?s despair becomes even more pronounced: now she believes that only a diseased and dangerous creature would ever voluntarily approach her. But then a new </p>

H?l?ne identifies strongly with Jane?s tribulations, and when she is lost in the pages of this wonderful book, she is able to ignore her tormentors. But when H?l?ne is humiliated on a class trip in front of her entire grade, she needs more than a fictional character to allow her to see herself as a person deserving of laughter and friendship.Leaving the outcasts? tent one night, H?l?ne encounters a fox, a beautiful creature with whom she shares a moment of connection.

But then a new </p>

<p>Summary : A revolutionary guide to designing humane, eco-conscious homes, buildings, and cities of the future.It is estimated that the earth&#8217;s population will expand to an unprecedented nine billion people over the next century. This explosion in population is predicted to place further stress on our environment, deplete our natural resources, and lead to increases in anxiety and depression due to overcrowding. In this visionary and uplifting book, Teresa Coady offers readers new hope. &#8216;REBUILDING EARTH&#8217; is her blueprint for designing and building the cities, buildings, and homes of tomorrow, resulting in more conscious, sustainable, and humane living. Coady shows us how we can shift from an outdated Industrial-Age framework to a more humane, Digital-Age framework. This revolutionary approach will enable communities to harness various forms of green energy and reduce the amount of material needed to build infrastructure while contributing to a healthier planet (and society). We can then </p>

<p>Summary : Sparkling with irrepressible wit, City of Djinns peels back the layers of Delhi&#8217;s centuries-old history, revealing an extraordinary array of characters along the way?from eunuchs to descendants of great Moguls. With refreshingly open-minded curiosity, William Dalrymple explores the seven &#8220;dead&#8221; cities of Delhi as well as the eighth city?today&#8217;s Delhi. Underlying his quest is the legend of the djinns, fire-formed spirits that are said to assure the city&#8217;s Phoenix-like regeneration no matter how many times it is destroyed. Entertaining, fascinating, and informative, City of Djinns is an irresistible blend of research and adventure.</p>

<p>Summary : He is twice my age. A convicted felon. A recluse.I was warned about meeting this man. My colleagues told me no one had seen him out of his home since he was released from prison. They told me he is a dangerous man. A murderer.But nowhere was the extent of his burns mentioned nor that his disability has turned him into a deeply depraved man whom I craved to learn more about. A man who had shut himself off from the world the same day he was released from prison. And still, I went, the allure of interviewing him in person too much to ignore.My desire to tell his story too strong. And then I met him and he all but took my breath away.My job as a journalist, the article I was to write, the reason for my visit no longer mattered. This wild, feral man who had defied all odds was all that mattered. With him, I finally felt like I belonged.FERAL is a riveting forbidden age-gap romance and a complete standalone with a HEA.

<p>Summary : Two old friends, one hot summer, a whole load of confusion. Poppy Jenkins makes everyone smile. She?s the heart of Wells, a beautiful village in mid-Wales, leaving light and laughter in her wake. She has a doting family, an errant dog and a little sister with a nose for mischief. But she?s the only gay in the village and it?s a long time since she kissed a girl: the chance of romance in sleepy Wells is rarer than a barking sheep. If she doesn?t think too hard, life is cosy, until a smart sports car barrels into town with the last woman Poppy wants to see behind the wheel. Beautiful Rosalyn Thorn was once Poppy?s high school BFF even though she was trouble. Then one day she abandoned Wells and Poppy without explanation. Now the highflier is back and bound to cause fresh havoc in the village and with Poppy?s heart; folk are not happy. Wells needs to wake up to the 21st century and Rosalyn can help, but old prejudices die hard. If they can be friends it could be the chance to make </p>

<p>Summary : Two old friends, one hot summer, a whole load of confusion. Poppy Jenkins makes everyone smile. She?s the heart of Wells, a beautiful village in mid-Wales, leaving light and laughter in her wake. She has a doting family, an errant dog and a little sister with a nose for mischief. But she?s the only gay in the village and it?s a long time since she kissed a girl: the chance of romance in sleepy Wells is rarer than a barking sheep. If she doesn?t think too hard, life is cosy, until a smart sports car barrels into town with the last woman Poppy wants to see behind the wheel.

Now the highflier is back and bound to cause fresh havoc in the village and with Poppy?s heart; folk are not happy. Wells needs to wake up to the 21st century and Rosalyn can help, but old prejudices die hard. If they can be friends it could be the chance to make </p>

<p>Summary : The End of the Megamachine provides a uniquely comprehensive picture of the roots of the destructive forces that are threatening the future of humankind today. Spanning 5000 years of history, the book shows how the three tyrannies of militarized states, capital accumulation and ideological power have been steering both ecosystems and societies to the brink of collapse. With the growing instability of the Megamachine in the 21st century, new dangers open up as well as new possibilities for systemic change, to which everyone can contribute.</p>

<p>Summary : Explores the author?s family history in graphic novel format, examining the emotional baggage of violence, abandonment, and displacement.Uprooted from her childhood in Germany and set adrift in the American Midwest, Maureen was raised by a kind but neglectful mother who loved Jesus more than her own child and a stern, disinterested grandmother who waxed nostalgic about Nazi Germany. Growing up queer and isolated, Maureen often felt unmoored and unloved.Years later, Maureen reflects upon her complicated past. Queen of Snails follows Maureen through time and memory in her quest to untangle the trauma passed down to her over three generations of women. Part memoir and part family history, Queen of Snails is a beautifully drawn, powerful story that examines and transmutes the emotional baggage of violence, abandonment, and displacement.</p>

<p>Summary : Arguing about sports is as old as the games people play. Over the years sports debates have become muddled by many myths that do not match the numbers generated by those playing the games. In The Wages of Wins, the authors use layman&#8217;s language and easy to follow examples based on their own academic research to debunk many of the most commonly held beliefs about sports.In this updated version of their book, these authors explain why Allen Iverson leaving Philadelphia made the 76ers a better team, why the Yankees find it so hard to repeat their success from the late 1990s, and why even great quarterbacks like Brett Favre are consistently inconsistent. The book names names, and makes it abundantly clear that much of the decision making of coaches and general managers does not hold up to an analysis of the numbers. Whether you are a fantasy league fanatic or a casual weekend fan, much of what you believe about sports will change after reading this book.</p>

<p>Summary : Weaving a tapestry of fact and fiction, Sara Donati?s epic novel sweeps us into another time and place&#8230; and into a breathtaking story of love and survival in a land of savage beauty.It is December of 1792. Elizabeth Middleton leaves her comfortable English estate to join her family in a remote New York mountain village. It is a place unlike any she has ever experienced. And she meets a man unlike any she has ever encountered?a white man dressed like a Native American: Nathaniel Bonner, known to the Mohawk people as Between-Two-Lives. Determined to provide schooling for all the children of the village, Elizabeth soon finds herself locked in conflict with the local slave owners as well as with her own family. Interweaving the fate of the Mohawk Nation with the destiny of two lovers, Sara Donati?s compelling novel creates a complex, profound, passionate portait of an emerging America.Praise for Into the Wilderness?My favorite kind of book is the sort you live in, rather than read. </p>

<p>Summary : Our competitive, service-oriented societies are taking a toll on the late-modern individual. Rather than improving life, multitasking, &#8220;user-friendly&#8221; technology, and the culture of convenience are producing disorders that range from depression to attention deficit disorder to borderline personality disorder. Byung-Chul Han interprets the spreading malaise as an inability to manage negative experiences in an age characterized by excessive positivity and the universal availability of people and goods. Stress and exhaustion are not just personal experiences, but social and historical phenomena as well. Denouncing a world in which every against-the-grain response can lead to further disempowerment, he draws on literature, philosophy, and the social and natural sciences to explore the stakes of sacrificing intermittent intellectual reflection for constant neural connection.</p>

<p>Summary : Frogs are the most important ingredient in a witch&#8217;s favorite treat&#8211;but they are also the hardest to get into the cauldron!

<p>Summary : An alternative cover edition for this ASIN can be found here.I hunt dragons.Well, not really, I use my camera and I manage to get some awesome pics. Too bad everyone else is terrified of them.Though, I guess given my history of doing anything for an adrenaline rush, people shouldn?t be surprised that I spend every weekend scaling the mountains in Yellowstone in the hopes that I can get close to one.What people don?t know is that I?m a thrill seeking junkie so that I don?t have to think about the man from my past who destroyed me.When his doppelganger shows up at the coffee shop where I work, I try to hide, but he won?t leave me alone because he wants to hunt down the dragons with me.Heck, no.But then people in the park start dying and everyone thinks it?s the dragons. I have to prove that it?s not which means I might have to trust the one man I can?t bear to look at.If I don?t, the dragons might be destroyed forever?</p>

Inspired by a teacher&amp;#8217;s question, &amp;#8220;How do you fit it all in?&amp;#8221; they identified and prioritized the daily, essential, belief-based practices that are worth spending time on. They asked, &amp;#8220;Who will these students be as readers and writers after a year under our care?&amp;#8221;What we make time for matters: what we plan, how we revise our plans while teaching, and how we reflect and decide what&amp;#8217;s next.

<p>Summary : En los valles afganos y en los campos de refugiados de Paquist?n, las mujeres past?n improvisan cantos de gran intensidad y fulgurante los landays (?breves?). Esta forma po?tica limitada a dos versos crea una instant?nea de emoci?n, apenas un grito, un furor, una pu?alada en el pecho. Estos poemas, dotados de un marcado ritmo interno, hablan de amor, honor y muerte, y, vali?ndose de estos temas, de rebeld?a siempre. Sin duda, nunca un canto tan breve revel? tanto de la inhumana condici?n de la mujer y de la opresi?n que la reduce al estado de objeto dom?stico y la somete al c?digo pueril de los hombres. Privada de libertad y vejada en sus deseos y su cuerpo, a la mujer past?n no le queda otra salida posible que el suicidio o el canto&#8230;</p>

<p>Summary : A mythic love story set in Trinidad and Tobago, Ayanna Lloyd Banwo&#8217;s radiant debut introduces two unforgettable outsiders brought together by their connection with the dead. You were never the smartest child, but even you should know that when a dead woman offers you a cigarette, the polite thing to do would be to take it. Especially when that dead woman is your mother.The St. Bernard women have lived in Morne Marie, the house on top of a hill outside Port Angeles, for generations. Built from the ashes of a plantation that enslaved their ancestors, it has come to shelter a lineage that is bonded by much more than blood. One woman in each generation of St. Bernards is responsible for the passage of the city&#8217;s souls into the afterlife. But Yejide&#8217;s relationship with her mother, Petronella, has always been contorted by anger and neglect, which Petronella stubbornly carries to her death bed, leaving Yejide unprepared to fulfill her destiny.Raised in the countryside by a devout </p>

<p>Summary : In the beginning, there was nothing but endless flatness. Then came the Carpet&#8230;That&#8217;s the old story everyone knows and loves (even if they don&#8217;t really believe it). But now the Carpet is home to many different tribes and peoples, and there&#8217;s a new story in the making. The story of Fray, sweeping a trail of destruction across the Carpet. The story of power-hungry mouls &#8211; and of two Munrung brothers, who set out on an adventure to end all adventures when their village is flattened. It&#8217;s a story that will come to a terrible end &#8211; if someone doesn&#8217;t do something about it. If everyone doesn&#8217;t do something about it&#8230;This is a fantasy co-written by Terry Pratchett, aged seventeen, and master storyteller, Terry Pratchett, aged forty-three.</p>

<p>Summary : Ten years after her death, Princess Diana remains a mystery. Was she &#8220;the people&#8217;s princess,&#8221; who electrified the world with her beauty and humanitarian missions?

<p>Summary : Most people&#8211;Christians and non-Christians alike&#8211;are familiar with the garden of Eden, the perfect paradise that God created for the first man and woman. However, many don&#8217;t realize the Bible teaches that God is preparing an even better world for his people in the future new creation. In this book, experienced Bible teacher Nancy Guthrie traces 9 themes&#8211;the tree of life, garden and wilderness, the image of God, clothing, Sabbath rest, marriage, the seed of the Serpent, the temple, and the city of Jerusalem&#8211;throughout the Bible, revealing how God&#8217;s plan for the new heaven and the new earth is far better than anything we can possibly imagine. What&#8217;s more, she shows how this better world is already having an impact in the world today. Combining theological depth with warmth and accessibility aimed at addressing today&#8217;s needs, this book will help individuals or small groups understand the story of God&#8217;s plan for the future of his people.</p>

However, many don&#8217;t realize the Bible teaches that God is preparing an even better world for his people in the future new creation. In this book, experienced Bible teacher Nancy Guthrie traces 9 themes&#8211;the tree of life, garden and wilderness, the image of God, clothing, Sabbath rest, marriage, the seed of the Serpent, the temple, and the city of Jerusalem&#8211;throughout the Bible, revealing how God&#8217;s plan for the new heaven and the new earth is far better than anything we can possibly imagine. What&#8217;s more, she shows how this better world is already having an impact in the world today. Combining theological depth with warmth and accessibility aimed at addressing today&#8217;s needs, this book will help individuals or small groups understand the story of God&#8217;s plan for the future of his people.</p>

<p>Summary : Across the pine forests and deserts of America, there are mock Middle Eastern villages, mostly hidden from public view. Containing mosques, restaurants, street signs, graffiti in Arabic, and Iraqi role-players, these villages serve as military training sites for cultural literacy and special operations, both seen as crucial to victory in the Global War on Terror.In her gripping and highly original ethnography, anthropologist Nomi Stone explores US military predeployment training exercises and the lifeworlds of the Iraqi role-players employed within the mock villages, as they act out to mourn, bargain, and die like the wartime adversary or ally. Spanning fieldwork across the United States and Jordan, Pinelandia traces the devastating consequences of a military project that seeks to turn human beings into wartime technologies recruited to translate, mediate, and collaborate.Theorizing and enacting a field poetics, this work enlarges the ethnographic project into new cross-disciplinary </p>

Zuleikha herself is sent into exile, enduring a horrendous train journey to a remote spot on the Angara River in Siberia. Conditions in the camp are tough, and many of her group do not survive the first difficult winter.As she gradually settles into a routine, Zuleikha starts to get to know her companions. The eclectic group includes a rather dotty doctor, an artist who paints on the sly, and Ignatov, Zuleikha?s husband?s killer. Together, the group starts to build a new life, one that is far removed from those they left behind.Guzel Yakhina?s smooth prose describes Zuleikha?s adjustment to a new reality and her discovery of a new form of happiness, and covers a range of cultural, ethnic, religious and socio-political issues. This outstanding debut novel from an exciting new talent has been showered with prizes and is capturing the hearts of readers all over the world.</p>

<p>Summary : Flight Behavior is a brilliant and suspenseful novel set in present day Appalachia; a breathtaking parable of catastrophe and denial that explores how the complexities we inevitably encounter in life lead us to believe in our particular chosen truths. Kingsolver&#8217;s riveting story concerns a young wife and mother on a failing farm in rural Tennessee who experiences something she cannot explain, and how her discovery energizes various competing factions?religious leaders, climate scientists, environmentalists, politicians?trapping her in the center of the conflict and ultimately opening up her world. Flight Behavior is arguably Kingsolver&#8217;s must thrilling and accessible novel to date, and like so many other of her acclaimed works, represents contemporary American fiction at its finest.</p>

There is only one Zlatan.In the decade since his megaselling memoir I am Zlatan Ibrahimovic, he has played at Paris Saint-Germain (2012-2016), Manchester United (2016-2018), LA Galaxy (2018-2019) and Milan (2020-). This outrageous and hilarious follow-up is bursting with personal confessions and revealing anecdotes about the world&#8217;s best players and managers.Packed with revelations, in Adrenaline we hear for the first time what Zlatan really thinks about his time in the Premier League and what it was like to score that glorious bicycle kick against England. We hear about the club he very nearly signed for, and see his hilarious run-ins with the French media &#8211; and the French in general, really. Plus so much more.Zlatan transports you into the world of top-flight football like no one else. Filled with revelations &#8211; including </p>

With a name like Astra Noel Snow, holiday spirit isn&#8217;t just a seasonal specialty&#8211;it&#8217;s a way of life. But after a stinging divorce, Astra&#8217;s yearly trip to the Milwaukee Christmas market takes on a whole new meaning. She&#8217;s ready to eat, drink, and be merry, especially with the handsome stranger who saves the best kringle for her at his family bakery.For Jack Clausen, the Julemarked with its snowy lights and charming shops stays the same, while the world outside the joyful street changes, magically leaping from one December to the next every four weeks. He&#8217;s never minded living this charmed existence until Astra shows him the life he&#8217;s been missing outside of the festive red brick alley.After a swoon-worthy series of dates, some Yuletide magic, and the unexpected glow of new love, Astra and Jack must decide whether this relationship can weather all seasons, or if </p>

C. Gwynne?s Empire of the Summer Moon spans two astonishing stories. The first traces the rise and fall of the Comanches, the most powerful Indian tribe in American history. The second entails one of the most remarkable narratives ever to come out of the Old West: the epic saga of the pioneer woman Cynthia Ann Parker and her mixed-blood son Quanah, who became the last and greatest chief of the Comanches.Although readers may be more familiar with the tribal names Apache and Sioux, it was in fact the legendary fighting ability of the Comanches that determined just how and when the American West opened up. Comanche boys became adept bareback riders by age six; full Comanche braves were considered the best horsemen who ever rode. They </p>

<p>Summary : 3 volumiLa distruzione degli Ebrei d&#8217;Europa ? considerato uno dei maggiori contributi alla comprensione del meccanismo burocratico-amministrativo e militare che ha consentito lo sterminio di quasi sei milioni di Ebrei. Raul Hilberg, attenendosi scrupolosamente a centinaia di migliaia di documenti, ha ricostruito tutte le tappe del lungo cammino che ha condotto il nazismo a realizzare la ?soluzione finale della questione ebraica?. Dalla messa in luce degli antecedenti culturali su cui si fondava l&#8217;antisemitismo europeo e tedesco alle soglie del Novecento, fino alla promulgazione delle leggi razziali di Norimberga, tutto viene passato al setaccio: decreti, sentenze, leggi, verbali di riunioni, carteggi, diari personali, relazioni, rapporti militari e civili, fino alla ricostruzione degli intrecci complessi che hanno consentito a un&#8217;intera societ? di dare il proprio quotidiano contributo allo sterminio.</p>

<p>Summary : How has feminism developed? What have feminists achieved? What can we learn from the global history of feminism?Feminism is the ongoing story of a profound historical transformation. Despite being repeatedly written off as a political movement that has achieved its aim of female liberation, it has been continually redefined as new generations of women campaign against the gender inequity of their age.In this absorbing book, historian Lucy Delap challenges the simplistic narrative of &#8216;feminist waves&#8217; &#8211; a sequence of ever more progressive updates ?- showing instead that feminists have been motivated by the specific concerns of their historical moment. Drawing on an extraordinary range of examples from Japan to Russia, Egypt to Germany, Delap explores different feminist projects to show that those who are part of this movement have not always agreed on a single programme. This diverse history of feminism, she argues, can help us better navigate current debates and controversies.A tour </p>

<p>Summary : How has feminism developed? What have feminists achieved? What can we learn from the global history of feminism?Feminism is the ongoing story of a profound historical transformation. Despite being repeatedly written off as a political movement that has achieved its aim of female liberation, it has been continually redefined as new generations of women campaign against the gender inequity of their age.In this absorbing book, historian Lucy Delap challenges the simplistic narrative of &#8216;feminist waves&#8217; &#8211; a sequence of ever more progressive updates ?- showing instead that feminists have been motivated by the specific concerns of their historical moment. Drawing on an extraordinary range of examples from Japan to Russia, Egypt to Germany, Delap explores different feminist projects to show that those who are part of this movement have not always agreed on a single programme. This diverse history of feminism, she argues, can help us better navigate current debates and controversies.A tour </p>

<p>Summary : As Anumith the Destroyer&#8217;s army draws nearer to the western realms, an alliance is forming to stand against him. The heir to the throne of Krimathe embarks upon a quest for the goddess Vela&#8211;a quest that the goddess has promised will give her strength enough to defeat the Destroyer.All that Laina must do is to stay silent&#8230;and serve a man she has sworn to kill. A man who helped destroy her family.The son of a demon warlord and only recently freed from years of torture, Saxen seeks to make amends to his people before facing the justice of the Krimathean queen&#8217;s blade. When a mysterious, silent woman who wears a questing cloak joins his small band of warriors, he only wishes to rid himself of her.But she isn&#8217;t so easy to get rid of&#8211;and fulfilling her quest might come at a far higher cost than Laina could imagine. For she might gain the strength to defeat the Destroyer&#8230;but what she needs from Saxen will destroy him first.</p>

<p>Summary : Liebe ist ein Opfer auf dem Altar der Macht.Im Kielwasser des Kejari ist alles zerst?rt worden, was Oraya einst f?r wahr hielt. Sie ist Gefangene in ihrem eigenen K?nigreich, trauert um ihren Vater und wei? nach einem ersch?tternden Verrat nicht einmal mehr die Wahrheit ?ber ihre eigene Herkunft. Ihr bleibt nur eine Gewissheit: Sie kann niemandem trauen, schon gar nicht Raihn.Das Haus der Nacht ist von Feinden umgeben. Raihns eigene Gefolgsleute sind nicht bereit, ihn als K?nig zu akzeptieren ? insbesondere, weil er einst ein Sklave war. Und auch das Haus des Blutes schl?gt seine Krallen in das K?nigreich und droht, es zu zerrei?en.Als Raihn Oraya ein geheimes B?ndnis anbietet, ist das ihre einzige Chance, ihr K?nigreich zur?ckzuerobern ? und Rache an ihrem ehemaligen Geliebten zu nehmen, der sie verraten hat. Dazu muss sie sich eine gef?hrliche uralte Macht zunutze machen, die an die gr??ten Geheimnisse ihres Vaters r?hrt.W?hrend Oraya ihre Vergangenheit entr?tselt und sich ihrer </p>

<p>Summary : In Victorian England a witch and a detective are on the hunt for a serial killer in an enthralling novel of magic and murder.After a nearly fatal blow to the skull, traumatized private detective Ian Cameron is found dazed and confused on a muddy riverbank in Victorian London. Among his effects: a bloodstained business card bearing the name of a master wizard and a curious pocket watch that doesn?t seem to tell time. To retrieve his lost memories, Ian demands answers from Edwina and Mary Blackwood, sister witches with a murky past. But as their secret is slowly unveiled, a dangerous mystery emerges on the darkened streets of London.To help piece together Ian?s lost time, he and Edwina embark on a journey that will take them from the river foreshore to an East End music hall, and on to a safe house for witches in need of sanctuary from angry mortals. The clues they find suggest a link between a series of gruesome murders, a missing person?s case, and a dreadful suspicion that threatens </p>

Anastasia Allen has worked her entire life for a shot at Team USA.

No obstante, cuando se sacraliza esta est?tica pagana convirtiendo a los animales ?tanto reales como imaginarios? en portadores de virtudes o perversiones, empiezan a plagar capiteles, canecillos, metopas, t?mpanos, arquivoltas, muros, pilas bautismales, objetos lit?rgicos y una incontable serie de soportes que, lejos de la mera funci?n ornamental, aportan un significado simb?lico cuyo sentido trata de desentra?arse en este libro.El bestiario fant?stico es uno de los motivos escult?ricos que m?s inter?s genera, y el que mayor efecto de intimidaci?n provoca en el hombre medieval.

No obstante, cuando se sacraliza esta est?tica pagana convirtiendo a los animales ?tanto reales como imaginarios? en portadores de virtudes o perversiones, empiezan a plagar capiteles, canecillos, metopas, t?mpanos, arquivoltas, muros, pilas bautismales, objetos lit?rgicos y una incontable serie de soportes que, lejos de la mera funci?n ornamental, aportan un significado simb?lico cuyo sentido trata de desentra?arse en este libro.El bestiario fant?stico es uno de los motivos escult?ricos que m?s inter?s genera, y el que mayor efecto de intimidaci?n provoca en el hombre medieval. Estas peculiares e imaginativas bestias nac?an por combinaci?n de partes de animales diferentes, creando estampas, en ocasiones, atroces. Los animales pod?an ser representados solos, en lucha entre s? o con hombres indefensos, siempre con el objetivo de conmover </p>

<p>Summary : Every psychopath in the Mulvaney family has a role to play. Archer Mulvaney is the gambler, a drunken reprobate making his living as a high-stakes poker player. Very few people know the real Archer, not even his brothers. But there is one man who knows far too much.Mackenzie Shepherd spends his days photographing endangered wildlife. He?s also the brother of a psychopath and son to the woman who literally wrote the book on raising one. When his mother asks him to head a secret government project, it seems like the perfect excuse to run away from his life.But running from his past has Mac colliding straight into Archer. And that?s a problem. For this project to be successful, Mac and Archer have to agree on every decision, and the two see eye-to-eye on nothing. Except, maybe the sex. The sex is off the charts.When Mac?s old life comes back to haunt him, Archer insists on putting their differences aside to help keep him safe. But Mac, like Archer, is used to solving things on his own. </p>

<p>Summary : The heart is a battlefield. All Talasyn has ever known is the Hurricane Wars. Growing up an orphan in a nation under siege by the ruthless Night Emperor, Talasyn has found her family among the soldiers who fight for freedom. But she is hiding a deadly secret: light magic courses through her veins, a blazing power believed to have been wiped out years ago that can cut through the Night Empire&#8217;s shadows. Prince Alaric, the emperor&#8217;s only son and heir, has been forged into a weapon by his father. Tasked with obliterating any threats to the Night Empire&#8217;s rule with the strength of his armies and mighty Shadow magic, Alaric has never been bested. That is until he sees Talasyn burning brightly on the battlefield with the magic that killed his grandfather, turned his father into a monster, and ignited the Hurricane Wars. In a clash of light and dark, their powers merge and create a force the likes of which has never been seen. Talasyn and Alaric both know this war can only end with them. </p>

Prince Alaric, the emperor&amp;#8217;s only son and heir, has been forged into a weapon by his father. Tasked with obliterating any threats to the Night Empire&amp;#8217;s rule with the strength of his armies and mighty Shadow magic, Alaric has never been bested. That is until he sees Talasyn burning brightly on the battlefield with the magic that killed his grandfather, turned his father into a monster, and ignited the Hurricane Wars. In a clash of light and dark, their powers merge and create a force the likes of which has never been seen. Talasyn and Alaric both know this war can only end with them.

<p>Summary : Bestselling Canadian poet Nicole Lyons weaves together beloved pieces from her previous volumes Hush, I Am a World of Uncertainties Disguised as a Girl, and Blossom and Bone with new writing into powerful documentation of her journey as a writer. Her poetry and prose are wholly relatable, taking us deep inside the heart, and the human condition. Unafraid to bare her soul, she shares her struggles skillfully crafted with every line, giving the reader permission to take a glimpse into their own. Her readers are sensitive and smart, and Lyons understands this. JUST YOU WAIT says it all, ?Be patient, pretty little tragic one, the real suffering has not yet begun.??If we ever needed a poet laureate of brave, broken, real people who survive the darkness, Nicole Lyons would get my vote, as she is my queen of hearts. She?s a heart breaker, a heart mender, a best friend, a warrior, a solace, a rage against the dying light and a new element in the natural world that they haven?t yet named. </p>

Although they appear to have everything, they are missing something of great importance. It is up to Jonas, with the help of the Giver, to find what long ago had been lost. And so Jonas embarks on an adventure to save the world as he knows it. Simply and beautifully written, The Giver is sure </p>

<p>Summary : Steven Erikson returns to the Malazan world with the second book in a dark and revelatory new epic fantasy trilogy, one that takes place a millennium before the events in his New York Times bestselling Malazan Book of the Fallen. Fall of Light continues to tell the tragic story of the downfall of an ancient realm, a story begun in the critically acclaimed Forge of Darkness.It&#8217;s a conflicted time in Kurald Galain, the realm of Darkness, where Mother Dark reigns. But this ancient land was once home to many a power&#8230; and even death is not quite eternal. The commoners&#8217; great hero, Vatha Urusander, is being promoted by his followers to take Mother Dark&#8217;s hand in marriage, but her Consort, Lord Draconus, stands in the way of such ambitions. The impending clash sends fissures throughout the realm. As rumors of civil war burn through the masses, an ancient power emerges from the long dead seas. Caught in the middle of it all are the First Sons of Darkness, Anomander, Andarist, and Silchas </p>

Nei caff? si tira tardi, il sogno pi? bello ? quello che si sogna insieme. Sogna anche una ragazza tedesca: ha ventitr? anni, si chiama Greta e vuole fare l&#8217;attrice.

<p>Summary : What does the Bible say about economics? A lot. What about socialism, which is becoming an increasingly common concern in US economic policy discussions?In Biblical Economic Policy, Arnott and Saydometov build a biblical framework for analyzing national economic policy that takes on everything from taxes to spending to tariffs to minimum wage. The Bible has something to say about all these critical present-day issues, and this book explains how to apply it to 21st-century policies.Authors Dave Arnott and Sergiy Saydometov hold up the mirror of the Bible and ask their fellow Christians, &#8220;Is this the way we&#8217;re supposed to run a biblical economy?&#8221;What the book is not? It is NOT a financial advice book.? It is NOT about how to apply business principles at work.? It is NOT about stewardship or giving.? It is NOT about how to run your business for the glory of God.Biblical Economic Policy takes the macroeconomic view and analyzes how well America&#8217;s economic policies align with biblical </p>

<p>Summary : It&#8217;s a story that made Dutch painter Han van Meegeren famous worldwide when it?broke at the end of World War II: A lifetime of disappointment drove?him to forge Vermeers, one of which he sold to Hermann Goering in?mockery of the Nazis. And it&#8217;s a story that&#8217;s been believed ever since.?Too bad?it isn&#8217;t true. Jonathan Lopez has drawn on never-before-seen documents from dozens of archives to write a revelatory new biography of the world?s most famous forger. Neither unappreciated artist nor antifascist hero, Van Meegeren emerges as an ingenious, dyed-in-the-wool crook?a talented Mr. Ripley armed with a paintbrush. Lopez explores a network of illicit commerce that operated across Europe: Not only was Van Meegeren a key player in that high-stakes game in the 1920s and &#8217;30s, landing fakes with famous collectors such as Andrew Mellon, but he and his associates later?cashed in on the Nazi occupation. The Man Who Made Vermeers?is a long-overdue unvarnishing of Van Meegeren?s legend and a </p>

The Four Roses, as the farmhouse is called, is a labor of love?but Ivy didn&#8217;t bargain on just how much labor.

What mysteries did the Rose family hold?Ivy&#8217;s quest brings her into the community, at a time when all she wanted to do was be left </p>

<p>Summary : From a critically acclaimed creator comes this summery picture book featuring an overheated&#8211;and overwhelmed&#8211;pup who finds his calm with some sea, sand, and fresh air. It&#8217;s summer in the city, and this hot dog has had enough! Enough of sizzling sidewalks, enough of wailing sirens, enough of people&#8217;s feet right in his face. When he plops down in the middle of a crosswalk, his owner endeavors to get him the breath of fresh air he needs. She hails a taxi, hops a train, and ferries out to the beach.Here, a pup can run!With fluid art and lyrical text that have the soothing effect of waves on sand, Doug Salati shows us how to find calm and carry it back with us so we can appreciate the small joys in a day.</p>

<p>Summary : Questions of how the design of cities can respond to the challenge of climate change dominate the thoughts of urban planners and designers across the U.S. and Canada. With admirable clarity, Patrick Condon responds to these questions. He addresses ?transportation, housing equity, job distribution, economic development, and ecological systems issues and synthesizes his knowledge and research into a simple-to-understand set of urban design recommendations.No other book so clearly connects the form of our cities to their ecological, economic, and social consequences. No other book takes on this breadth of complex and contentious issues and distills them down to such convincing and practical solutions.</p>

<p>Summary : So you&#8217;ve fallen in love with space and now you want to see it for yourself, huh? You want to witness the birth of a star, or visit the black hole at the center of our galaxy? You want to know if there are aliens out there, or how to travel through a wormhole? You want the wonders of the universe revealed before your very eyes? Well stop, because all that will probably kill you. From mundane comets in our solar backyard to exotic remnants of the Big Bang, from dying stars to young galaxies, the universe may be beautiful, but it&#8217;s treacherous. Through metaphors and straightforward language, it breathes life into astrophysics, unveiling how particles and forces and fields interplay to create the drama in the heavens above us.</p>

  WOMEN DON&#8217;T OWE YOU PRETTY will tell you to&#8230;</p>
<p>  love sex, hate sexism,</p>
<p>  protect your goddamn energy,</p>
<p>  life is short, dump them,</p>
<p>  And that you owe men nothing, least of all pretty. <br />
Florence&#8217;s debut book will explore all progressive corners of the feminist conversation; from insecurity projection and refusing to find comfort in other women&#8217;s flaws, to deciding whether to date or dump them, all the way through to unpacking the male gaze and how it shapes our identity.WOMEN DON&#8217;T OWE YOU PRETTY is an accessible leap into feminism, for people at all stages of their journey who are seeking to reshape and transform the way they view themselves. In a world that tells women we&#8217;re either not enough or too much, it&#8217;s time we stop directing our anger and insecurities onto ourselves, and start fighting back to re-shape the toxic structures of our patriarchal society.Florence&#8217;s book will help you to tackle and challenge the limiting narrative you have been bombarded with your </p>

<p>Summary : The first volume of a two part set on the history of the Galician Division is based on over 25 years research by accomplished historian Michael James Melnyk who has sourced additional new and hitherto unseen original material on all aspects of the Division s history from archives and private collections in Europe, Australia, North American and Canada. Complemented by the individual accounts and contributions of many veterans which add an engaging personal dimension, this new definitive two volume account supersedes his earlier divisional history published in 2002. As a recognized authority on the subject he has produced the most reliable and exhaustive account to date lavishly illustrated with many rare and unique photos and crammed full of details, notes and references in this last ever book to include direct and new material from the participants.</p>

<p>Summary : Rikugun: Guide to Japanese Ground Forces 1937-1945 is the first nuts-and-bolts handbook to utilize both the voluminous raw allied intelligence documents and postwar Japanese documentation as primary sources. This first volume covers the tactical organization of Army and Navy ground forces during the 1937-45 war. Using the wartime Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) mobilization plans, and the Unit Organization Tables, Unit Strength Tables and Unit History Tables compiled by the War Ministry and the 1st Demobilization Bureau during and after the war, a complete picture of IJA ground forces through the war is presented. The evolution of the Japanese force structure is examined, including infantry, armor, cavalry, artillery and naval ground combat units from battalion to division level, each thoroughly discussed and illustrated with tables of organization and equipment and mobilization data. This forms the framework for any discussion of the Imperial Japanese Army&#8217;s capabilities and intentions.</p>

This forms the framework for any discussion of the Imperial Japanese Army&#8217;s capabilities and intentions.</p>

<p>Summary : What does diaspora mean? Until quite recently, the word had a specific and restricted meaning, referring principally to the dispersal and exile of the Jews. But since the 1960s, the term diaspora has proliferated to a remarkable extent, to the point where it is now applied to migrants of almost every kind.This Very Short Introduction explains where the concept of diaspora came from, how its meaning changed over time, why its usage has expanded so dramatically in recent years, and how it can both clarify and distort the nature of migration. Kevin Kenny highlights the strength of diaspora as a mode of explanation, focusing on three key elements&#8211;movement, connectivity, and return&#8211;and illustrating his argument with examples drawn from Jewish, Armenian, African, Irish, and Asian diasporas. He shows that diaspora is not simply a synonym for the movement of people. Its explanatory power is greatest when people believe that their departure was forced rather than voluntary. Thus diaspora </p>

<p>Summary : How the archive evolved to include new technologies, practices, and media, and how it became the apparatus through which we map the everyday.In Archive Everything, Gabriella Giannachi traces the evolution of the archive into the apparatus through which we map the everyday. The archive, traditionally a body of documents or a site for the preservation of documents, changed over the centuries to encompass, often concurrently, a broad but interrelated number of practices not traditionally considered as archival. Archives now consist of not only documents and sites but also artworks, installations, museums, social media platforms, and mediated and mixed reality environments. Giannachi tracks the evolution of these diverse archival practices across the centuries.Archives today offer a multiplicity of viewing platforms to replay the past, capture the present, and map our presence. Giannachi uses archaeological practices to explore all the layers of the archive, analyzing Lynn Hershman </p>

<p>Summary : Contemporary art can be baffling and beautiful, provocative and disturbing. This pioneering book presents a new look at the controversial period between 1945 and 2015, when art and its traditional forms were called into question. It focuses on the relationship between American and European art, and challenges previously held views about the origins of some of the most innovative ideas in art of this time.Major artists such as Jackson Pollock, Robert Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol, Joseph Beuys, Gerhard Richter, Louise Bourgeois, Cindy Sherman, Jeff Koons, and Shiran Neshat are all discussed, as is the art world of the last fifty years. Important trends are also covered including Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art, Minimalism, Conceptualism, Postmodernism, and Performance Art.This revised and updated second edition includes a new chapter exploring art since 2000 and how globalization has caused shifts in the art world, an updated Bibliography, and 16 new, colour illustrations.</p>

<p>Summary : Contemporary art can be baffling and beautiful, provocative and disturbing. This pioneering book presents a new look at the controversial period between 1945 and 2015, when art and its traditional forms were called into question. It focuses on the relationship between American and European art, and challenges previously held views about the origins of some of the most innovative ideas in art of this time.Major artists such as Jackson Pollock, Robert Rauschenberg, Andy Warhol, Joseph Beuys, Gerhard Richter, Louise Bourgeois, Cindy Sherman, Jeff Koons, and Shiran Neshat are all discussed, as is the art world of the last fifty years. Important trends are also covered including Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art, Minimalism, Conceptualism, Postmodernism, and Performance Art.This revised and updated second edition includes a new chapter exploring art since 2000 and how globalization has caused shifts in the art world, an updated Bibliography, and 16 new, colour illustrations.</p>

<p>Summary : Un viaggio illustrato nella musica per i lettori di tutte le et?: dal Trio Lescano a Vasco Rossi, da Frank Sinatra a Battisti, dai Watussi a Bob Dylan.  ?La canzone ? una sintesi basata sull?equilibrio tra musica e parole, preferibilmente melodica, ricordabile, per meritarsi il titolo di canzone. Un po? come le arie nell?opera, perch? ? da l? che nascono i primi motivi supportati dalle parole che poi la gente canta e fischia per la strada. La canzone per? ? soprattutto emozione, vibrazione, evoca luoghi, periodi, sensazioni. ? voce, timbrica, intensit? interpretativa, virtuosismo o semplicit?. La canzone ? un grido oppure un sospiro, un sussurro. La canzone ? d?amore, quasi sempre. C?? la canzone di protesta, di denuncia, ma le canzoni che cantiamo sotto la doccia, quando fa freddo in motorino, nelle serate con gli amici, nove volte su dieci parlano d?amore. La canzone ? immagine, niente come una canzone ti fa vedere, intuire quello che stai ascoltando. La canzone che esce dalla </p>

<p>Summary : El estudio antropol?gico de la condici?n femenina realizado por Marcela Lagarde enriquece los instrumentos epistemol?gicos de la disciplina, al construir la categor?a cautiverio como s?ntesis del hecho cultural que define el estado de las mujeres en el mundo patriarcal. El problema de investigaci?n del que parte esta obra es el reconocimiento de que las formas de ser mujer en esta sociedad y de sus culturas, constituyen cautiverios en los que sobreviven creativamente las mujeres en opresi?n. Para la mayor?a de las mujeres la vivencia del cautiverio significa sufrimiento, conflictos, contrariedades y dolor, pero hay felices cautivas. En su investigaci?n, la autora examina dos ejes fundamentales en torno a los que se estructura la condici?n gen?rica de las mujeres: la sexualidad escindida y su definici?n en relaci?n con el poder. De la estancia con las mujeres, acci?n metodol?gica por dem?s compleja, descubre que las mujeres son diversas y diversos sus cautiverios.</p>

<p>Summary : El estudio antropol?gico de la condici?n femenina realizado por Marcela Lagarde enriquece los instrumentos epistemol?gicos de la disciplina, al construir la categor?a cautiverio como s?ntesis del hecho cultural que define el estado de las mujeres en el mundo patriarcal. El problema de investigaci?n del que parte esta obra es el reconocimiento de que las formas de ser mujer en esta sociedad y de sus culturas, constituyen cautiverios en los que sobreviven creativamente las mujeres en opresi?n. Para la mayor?a de las mujeres la vivencia del cautiverio significa sufrimiento, conflictos, contrariedades y dolor, pero hay felices cautivas. En su investigaci?n, la autora examina dos ejes fundamentales en torno a los que se estructura la condici?n gen?rica de las mujeres: la sexualidad escindida y su definici?n en relaci?n con el poder. De la estancia con las mujeres, acci?n metodol?gica por dem?s compleja, descubre que las mujeres son diversas y diversos sus cautiverios.</p>

<p>Summary : Although Juicy Fruit? gum was introduced to North Americans in 1893, Native Americans in Mesoamerica were chewing gum thousands of years earlier. And although in the last decade &#8220;biographies&#8221; have been devoted to salt, spices, chocolate, coffee, and other staples of modern life, until now there has never been a full history of chewing gum.Chicle is a history in four acts, all of them focused on the sticky white substance that seeps from the sapodilla tree when its bark is cut. First, Jennifer Mathews recounts the story of chicle and its earliest-known adherents, the Maya and Aztecs. Second, with the assistance of botanist Gillian Schultz, Mathews examines the sapodilla tree itself, an extraordinarily hardy plant that is native only to Mesoamerica and the Caribbean. Third, Mathews presents the fascinating story of the chicle and chewing gum industry over the last hundred plus years, a tale (like so many twentieth-century tales) of greed, growth, and collapse. In closing, Mathews </p>

<p>Summary : An argument that we should be optimistic about the capacity of &#8220;methodologically omnivorous&#8221; geologists, paleontologists, and archaeologists to uncover truths about the deep past.The &#8220;historical sciences&#8221;&#8211;geology, paleontology, and archaeology&#8211;have made extraordinary progress in advancing our understanding of the deep past. How has this been possible, given that the evidence they have to work with offers mere traces of the past? In Rock, Bone, and Ruin, Adrian Currie explains that these scientists are &#8220;methodological omnivores,&#8221; with a variety of strategies and techniques at their disposal, and that this gives us every reason to be optimistic about their capacity to uncover truths about prehistory. Creative and opportunistic paleontologists, for example, discovered and described a new species of prehistoric duck-billed platypus from a single fossilized tooth. Examining the complex reasoning processes of historical science, Currie also considers philosophical and scientific </p>

<p>Summary : A geometric dissection is a cutting of a geometric figure (such as a regular polygon, or a star, or a cross) into pieces that we can rearrange to form another geometric figure. The best dissections are beautiful and possess economy (few pieces), symmetry, or hingeability. They are often challenging to discover.Ernest Irving Freese was an architect who lived and worked in Los Angeles until his death in 1957. Shortly before he passed away, he completed a 200-page manuscript on geometric dissection, the first book-length treatment on that subject. Freese included elegant drawings of dissections that were both original and clever. After his death the manuscript lay forgotten in his former house until Greg Frederickson set in motion its recovery in 2003. What a treat that it was rescued!Frederickson&#8217;s book sketches a history of geometric dissections and a biography of Freese, followed by a refurbished copy of Freese&#8217;s manuscript interleaved with a commentary that highlights Freese&#8217;s major </p>

<p>Summary : This book by the author of Why Am I Afraid to Love? contains insights on self-awareness, personal growth and communication with others. Why do people continually hide their real selves from the people around them? Why are so many so insecure and afraid to open up? The answer, explains John Powell, is that maturity is reached by communicating and interacting with others. This book considers the consequences our real self faces if no one else ever finds out what we are like. In this enduring classic, the companion to Why Am I Afraid to Love?, John Powell explains how to be more emotionally open, and shows how people adopt roles and play psychological games to protect their inner selves. The courage to be our real selves can be developed, and then we can begin to grow. Now newly designed for a fresh audience, Why Am I Afraid to Tell You Who I Am? is as relevant as it has been for twenty years. With a proven track record, it continues to speak to the needs and aspirations of people </p>

Why do people continually hide their real selves from the people around them? Why are so many so insecure and afraid to open up? The answer, explains John Powell, is that maturity is reached by communicating and interacting with others. This book considers the consequences our real self faces if no one else ever finds out what we are like. In this enduring classic, the companion to Why Am I Afraid to Love?, John Powell explains how to be more emotionally open, and shows how people adopt roles and play psychological games to protect their inner selves. The courage to be our real selves can be developed, and then we can begin to grow. Now newly designed for a fresh audience, Why Am I Afraid to Tell You Who I Am? is as relevant as it has been for twenty years.

<p>Summary : They say one action doesn?t define you. I killed a man. Stabbed him in the neck and licked the blood off my lips after I did it. Still, one action doesn?t define you. I could have called anyone. My father, the Prez of The Fallen MC, our family lawyer, my best friend, Lila, or my brother, King. I didn?t. Instead, I called Lionel Danner, the police officer renowned for taking down the Nightstalkers MC. The man who had been my father?s arch nemesis for decades. The man who hated everything I stood for. A man who had disappeared from my life without explanation three years ago. I called him. And maybe one action doesn?t define you, but killing a bad man and calling in the good changed my life and it sure as hell changed his.  The third book in the Fallen Men series. A standalone featuring Harleigh Rose and Officer Lionel Danner.</p>

<p>Summary : Boss from hell. Satan personified. A tyrant everyone fears.Nate Parrish loathes his boss from the moment they meet.Raffaele Ferrara is probably the most insufferable, domineering man in the world. He doesn?t seem to understand that his personal assistant isn?t actually his personal slave. He expects Nate to do his bidding with a single word. He expects that Nate?s whole life will revolve around him. He expects other, entirely unreasonable things, even though they?re both straight and there?s supposed to be a line your boss should never cross. Apparently, as his personal assistant, Nate has to assist him? personally.Except Nate knows it?s just a game. His boss is straight. He knows Raffaele just wants to make him angry enough to quit. But Nate has always been too stubborn for his own good, and he?s determined to be the best assistant his boss has ever had, no matter how insane?or inappropriate?Raffaele?s orders may become. Before long, the two men are drawn into a twisted game neither </p>

<p>Summary : From the 2017 John W. Campbell Award Winner for Best Writer, Ada Palmer&#8217;s Perhaps the Stars is the final book of the Hugo Award-shortlisted Terra Ignota series.World Peace turns into global civil war.In the future, the leaders of Hive nations?nations without fixed location?clandestinely committed nefarious deeds in order to maintain an outward semblance of utopian stability. But the facade could only last so long. The comforts of effortless global travel and worldwide abundance may have tempered humanity&#8217;s darkest inclinations, but conflict remains deeply rooted in the human psyche. All it needed was a catalyst, in form of special little boy to ignite half a millennium of repressed chaos.Now, war spreads throughout the globe, splintering old alliances and awakening sleeping enmities. All transportation systems are in ruins, causing the tyranny of distance to fracture a long-united Earth and threaten to obliterate everything the Hive system built.With the arch-criminal Mycroft nowhere </p>

<p>Summary : Emanuel Derman was one of the first physicists to move to Wall Street, and his career paralleled the growth of quantitative trading over the past twenty years. In My Life as a Quant, he traces his transformation from ambitious young scientist to managing director and head of the renowned Quantitative Strategies group at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.  Derman?s tale recounts his adventures with quants, traders and other high fliers on Wall Street as he became the best-known quant in the business. He describes the struggles of research and his interactions with an assorted cast of famous scientists. He relates his impressions of some of the most creative minds on Wall Street, including Fischer Black, with whom he collaborated on the widely used Black-Derman-Toy model of interest rates. Throughout his story he reflects on the appropriate way to apply the refined methods of physics to the hurly-burly world of markets and the people that inhabit them.</p>

<p>Summary : The stupid are all around they are in every place, in every class, ready to cause damage to others and naturally (they are stupid, are they not?) to themselves. The stupid form the most dangerous category of human beings. Woe betide those who underestimate them. The historian Carlo M. Cipolla wrote this essay in a constructive effort to detect, know, and thus possibly neutralize one of the most powerful, dark forces which hinder the growth of human welfare and happiness. And if it then proves impossible to save ourselves from stupidity, at least we can take vengeance by laughing at it.</p>

Chapters also include step-by-step guides for re-creating prehistoric debauchery in your modern life based on Evans&#8217;s firsthand fieldwork.

<p>Summary : Un libro sorprendente, osado y de alt?sima calidad literaria.Este es un libro sobre el cuerpo. Sobre un cuerpo que ama y es amado. Un cuerpo que tambi?n es abusado, violentado a trav?s del sexo y el parto, del aborto y la sangre, de la mugre. Materiales no art?sticos en manos de una pintora que escribe, de una escritora que mira.La anguila aborda la memoria y la herencia, habla sobre nacimientos y p?rdidas, sobre el deseo que traspasa generaciones, los gestos aprendidos y truncados. Sobre rebeliones y huidas, sobre la amistad y sobre Chile.Es el retrato de una mujer que asume los riesgos de mirar atr?s sin veladuras y se dirige hacia una vida nueva.</p>

<p>Summary : In 1950s America, it was remarkably easy for police to arrest almost anyone for almost any reason. The criminal justice system-and especially the age-old law of vagrancy-served not only to maintain safety and order but also to enforce conventional standards of morality and propriety. A person could be arrested for sporting a beard, making a speech, or working too little. Yet by the end of the 1960s, vagrancy laws were discredited and American society was fundamentally transformed. What happened? In Vagrant Nation, Risa Goluboff answers that question by showing how constitutional challenges to vagrancy laws shaped the multiple movements that made &#8220;the 1960s.&#8221; Vagrancy laws were so broad and flexible that they made it possible for the police to arrest anyone out of place: Beats and hippies; Communists and Vietnam War protestors; racial minorities and civil rights activists; gays, single women, and prostitutes. As hundreds of these &#8220;vagrants&#8221; and their lawyers challenged vagrancy laws </p>

<p>Summary : In 1950s America, it was remarkably easy for police to arrest almost anyone for almost any reason. The criminal justice system-and especially the age-old law of vagrancy-served not only to maintain safety and order but also to enforce conventional standards of morality and propriety. A person could be arrested for sporting a beard, making a speech, or working too little. Yet by the end of the 1960s, vagrancy laws were discredited and American society was fundamentally transformed. What happened? In Vagrant Nation, Risa Goluboff answers that question by showing how constitutional challenges to vagrancy laws shaped the multiple movements that made &#8220;the 1960s.&#8221; Vagrancy laws were so broad and flexible that they made it possible for the police to arrest anyone out of place: Beats and hippies; Communists and Vietnam War protestors; racial minorities and civil rights activists; gays, single women, and prostitutes. As hundreds of these &#8220;vagrants&#8221; and their lawyers challenged vagrancy laws </p>

<p>Summary : He?s a hot high school chemistry teacher living in a small town. She?s a globetrotting journalist running from her past. They used to be best friends. Then one kiss changes everything. Kate Fletcher is my kryptonite. She?s also my best friend. Former best friend? I?m not sure what you call it when we grew up attached at the hip and then she left Silver Creek (and me) to travel the world. The important thing Kate is back. (Temporarily.) And I?m still in love with her. (Permanently.) But something is different now. The attraction doesn?t seem one-sided. I don?t think I?m imagining the heat in Kate?s eyes or the chemistry crackling between us. But will that be enough to keep Kate here, when, for as long as I can remember, all she?s wanted to do is leave? I?m determined to give her a reason to stay. Family. Connection. Roots. And me. I?ll have to start with sparks and fire, but if I take this step, there?s no turning back to simple friendship. And if she doesn?t feel the same way, I </p>

<p>Summary : Los hijos de las cinco familias protagonistas de La ca?da de los gigantes forjar?n su destino en los a?os turbulentos de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, la guerra civil espa?ola, el bombardeo de Pearl Harbor y la era de la bomba at?mica.Segundo volumen de la trilog?a ?The Century?En el a?o 1933, Berl?n es un foco de agitaci?n pol?tica y social.

<p>Summary : In the course of research, Tim Spector has been shocked to discover how little scientific evidence there is for many of our most deep-rooted ideas about food. Is salt really bad for you? Is fish good for you? What about coffee, red meat, or saturated fats? Can pregnant women rely on their doctor?s advice about what to eat? Does gluten-free food carry any health benefits at all? Do doctors know anything about nutrition?In twenty short, myth-busting chapters, Tim Spector reveals why almost everything we?ve been told about food is wrong. He reveals the scandalous lack of good scientific evidence for many medical and government food recommendations, and how the food industry holds sway over these policies. These are urgent issues that matter not just for our health as individuals but for the future of the planet.Spoon-Fed forces us to question every diet plan, government recommendation, miracle cure or food label we encounter, and encourages us to rethink our whole relationship with food.</p>

<p>Summary : A reimagining of Charlotte Bront?s classic novel Jane Eyre set in present day, written by acclaimed screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna and Eisner Award-winning illustrator Ram?n K. P?rez.Growing up in a broken home in a small fishing town, Jane dreamed of escaping to art school and following the allure of New York City. When that dream becomes a reality however, it?s not long before she feels out of place by the size of the city and the talent of her peers. She soon discovers her place as she begins to nanny a young girl named Adele, but that is upended when she falls for the girl?s father, Rochester, a sardonic man of power, wealth, and unexpected charm. Jane learns that in the world of New York?s elite, secrets are the greatest extravagance and she?ll have to decide if she should trust the man she loves or do what ever it takes to protect Adele from the consequences of his deception.</p>
