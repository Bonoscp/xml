<p>Summary : <br />
  A crime leader has fallen for the wrong woman. She?s his hostage in a heist, and if he leaves any witnesses, his colleagues will kill them both. <br />
A hostage isn?t supposed to develop feelings for her captor?a man who?s the antithesis of everything I stand for. And my captor isn?t supposed to see me in a way no one else ever has, let alone want to protect me from the other men who plan to end my life?Surrendering to our unexpected feelings could spell death for us both. Especially when Easton is given a direct order: Kill me, or they?ll kill him and his brother.Soon, our lives, along with the lives of everyone we love, are in danger. And time is running out?You?ll love this dangerous romance (standalone with no cliffhanger, contains darker themes with mature content?reader discretion is advised) because the page-turner involving dark secrets, kidnapping, and murder will keep you glued to the pages with heart-pounding suspense and blow-your mind twists?Get it now.</p>

<p>Summary : When Apollo Kagwa?s father disappeared, all he left his son were strange recurring dreams and a box of books stamped with the word IMPROBABILIA. Now Apollo is a father himself?and as he and his wife, Emma, are settling into their new lives as parents, exhaustion and anxiety start to take their toll. Apollo?s old dreams return and Emma begins acting odd. Irritable and disconnected from their new baby boy, at first Emma seems to be exhibiting signs of postpartum depression, but it quickly becomes clear that her troubles go even deeper. Before Apollo can do anything to help, Emma commits a horrific act?beyond any parent?s comprehension?and vanishes, seemingly into thin air.Thus begins Apollo?s odyssey through a world he only thought he understood, to find a wife and child who are nothing like he?d imagined. His quest, which begins when he meets a mysterious stranger who claims to have information about Emma?s whereabouts, takes him to a forgotten island, a graveyard full of secrets, a </p>

She&#8217;s tired of being a nobody: a plain, invisible woman who blends into the background. She deserves more&#8211;a life of money and power like the one blond-haired, blue-eyed goddess Daphne Parrish takes for granted. To everyone in the exclusive town of Bishops Harbor, Connecticut, Daphne and her husband, Jackson&#8211;the beautiful philanthropist and the confident real estate mogul&#8211;are a golden couple straight out of a fairytale, blessed with two lovely young daughters.Amber&#8217;s envy could eat her alive &#8230; if she didn&#8217;t have a plan. Amber uses Daphne&#8217;s compassion and caring to insinuate herself into the family&#8217;s life&#8211;the first step in a meticulous scheme to undermine her. Before long, Amber is Daphne&#8217;s closest confidante, traveling to Europe with the Parrish family, and growing closer to Jackson. But a skeleton from her past may undermine everything that Amber has worked towards, </p>

<p>Summary : Samantha Heather Mackey couldn&#8217;t be more of an outsider in her small, highly selective MFA program at New England&#8217;s Warren University. A scholarship student who prefers the company of her dark imagination to that of most people, she is utterly repelled by the rest of her fiction writing cohort&#8211;a clique of unbearably twee rich girls who call each other &#8220;Bunny,&#8221; and seem to move and speak as one. But everything changes when Samantha receives an invitation to the Bunnies&#8217; fabled &#8220;Smut Salon,&#8221; and finds herself inexplicably drawn to their front door&#8211;ditching her only friend, Ava, in the process.

Soon, her friendships with Ava and the Bunnies will be brought into deadly collision. The spellbinding new novel from one of our most fearless chroniclers of the </p>

<p>Summary : Ansel Bray, an artist known around the world for his tragic hiatus from the canvas.Ansel Bray, a broody, handsome man not known by me, at all. Long dark hair, blue eyes, and dimpled cheeks. I?ve never met her, but her image is imprinted in my mind. An angel muse who inspires me to paint again.There is something about him. Something that spurs a need to be as close to him as possible. A need to find out why. There is something about her. Something that draws me in. Something that urges me to find out what her presence means.Why does the girl in his painting look so much like me? Who is this girl, and why can I see her so vividly?I shouldn?t fall in love with him. I shouldn?t fall in love at all.But fate plays her hand.But fate has other plans.The lines of my life will blur. The needs of my heart will change. <br />

<p>Summary : Based on a harrowing true story, the groundbreaking #1 New York Times bestseller, Looking for Mr. Goodbar, is a story of love, power, sex, and death during the sexual revolution of the 1970s.Theresa Dunn spends her days as a schoolteacher whose rigid Catholic upbringing has taught her to find happiness by finding the right man. But at night, her resentment of those social mores and fear of attachment lead her into the alcohol-and-drug fueled underworld of singles&amp;#8217; bars, where she engages in a pattern of dangerous sexual activity that threatens her safety and, ultimately, her life.Looking for Mr. Goodbar is &amp;#8220;uncommonly well-written and well-constructed fiction, easily accessible, but full of insight and intelligence and illumination&amp;#8221; (The New York Times Book Review). With more than four million copies in print, this seminal novel&amp;#8212;a lightning rod for controversy upon its publication&amp;#8212;has become a cultural touchstone that has forever </p>

Ma Lily e Kath sono disposte a rischiare tutto purch? il loro amore fiorisca alla luce del giorno.</p>

<p>Summary : Lily Hu ha diciassette anni e non ricorda esattamente quando sia nata in lei la domanda. Ma di sicuro la risposta l?ha trovata insieme a Kathleen Miller sotto l?insegna al neon del Telegraph Club, un locale per lesbiche. L?America del 1954, per?, non ? un luogo sicuro per due ragazze che si amano, soprattutto a Chinatown. La paranoia del maccartismo investe tutti, soprattutto i cittadini cinesi americani come la famiglia di Lily: nonostante il padre si sia duramente guadagnato la cittadinanza negli Stati Uniti, infatti, il rischio della deportazione ? ancora alto. Ma Lily e Kath sono disposte a rischiare tutto purch? il loro amore fiorisca alla luce del giorno.</p>

<p>Summary : The Hematoi descend from the unions of gods and mortals, and the children of two Hematoi pure bloods have godlike powers. Children of Hematoi and mortals&#8211;well, not so much. Half-bloods only have two options: become trained Sentinels who hunt and kill daimons or become servants in the homes of the pures.Seventeen-year-old Alexandria would rather risk her life fighting than waste it scrubbing toilets, but she may end up slumming it anyway. There are several rules that students at the Covenant must follow. Alex has problems with them all, but especially rule #1:Relationships between pures and halfs are forbidden. Unfortunately, she&#8217;s crushing hard on the totally hot pure-blood Aiden. But falling for Aiden isn&#8217;t her biggest problem&#8211;staying alive long enough to graduate the Covenant and become a Sentinel is.If she fails in her duty, she faces a future worse than death or slavery: being turned into a daimon, and being hunted by Aiden. And that would kind of suck.</p>

Half-bloods only have two options: become trained Sentinels who hunt and kill daimons or become servants in the homes of the pures.Seventeen-year-old Alexandria would rather risk her life fighting than waste it scrubbing toilets, but she may end up slumming it anyway. There are several rules that students at the Covenant must follow. Alex has problems with them all, but especially rule #1:Relationships between pures and halfs are forbidden. Unfortunately, she&#8217;s crushing hard on the totally hot pure-blood Aiden. But falling for Aiden isn&#8217;t her biggest problem&#8211;staying alive long enough to graduate the Covenant and become a Sentinel is.If she fails in her duty, she faces a future worse than death or slavery: being turned into a daimon, and being hunted by Aiden. And that would kind of suck.</p>

<p>Summary : Falling in love with the boss is never a good ideaMy boss works on the other side of the world, and that works just fine for me. When he barks out his instructions, I sit through the video call and nod, with the occasional smile to acknowledge how happy I am to be his dedicated New Zealand personal assistant. He only sees my face on-screen, though. He doesn?t see the way I?m stabbing my pen into the little paper doll I made of him ? or see the Days-Since-Grant-Price-Smiled chart (currently running at thirty-eight).When he does let his smile escape, it?s a game changer. He?s ridiculously handsome if you like dark blue eyes and a chiselled jaw, all wrapped up in a city suit.He?s only been to the Wellington office once in the last three years, and his schedule is so busy, there?s no chance of him coming anytime soon. And I?d know if he was planning an overseas trip, because I?d be the one booking his flights and hotel. Right?I was only out for two days of sick leave. So, when I return, </p>

<p>Summary : Falling in love with the boss is never a good ideaMy boss works on the other side of the world, and that works just fine for me. When he barks out his instructions, I sit through the video call and nod, with the occasional smile to acknowledge how happy I am to be his dedicated New Zealand personal assistant. He only sees my face on-screen, though. He doesn?t see the way I?m stabbing my pen into the little paper doll I made of him ? or see the Days-Since-Grant-Price-Smiled chart (currently running at thirty-eight).When he does let his smile escape, it?s a game changer. He?s ridiculously handsome if you like dark blue eyes and a chiselled jaw, all wrapped up in a city suit.He?s only been to the Wellington office once in the last three years, and his schedule is so busy, there?s no chance of him coming anytime soon. And I?d know if he was planning an overseas trip, because I?d be the one booking his flights and hotel. Right?I was only out for two days of sick leave. So, when I return, </p>

<p>Summary : Although Truman Capote&#8217;s last novel was unfinished at the time of his death, its surviving portions offer a devastating group portrait of the high and low society of his time.As it follows the career of a writer of uncertain parentage and omnivorous erotic tastes, Answered Prayers careens from a louche bar in Tangiers to a banquette at La C?te Basque, from literary salons to high-priced whorehouses. It takes in calculating beauties and sadistic husbands along with such real-life supporting characters as Colette, the Duchess of Windsor, Montgomery Clift, and Tallulah Bankhead. Above all, this malevolently funny book displays Capote at his most relentlessly observant and murderously witty.</p>

<p>Summary : Of #1 New York Times?bestselling author Sue Grafton, NPR?s Maureen Corrigan said, ?Makes me wish there were more than 26 letters.? With only two letters left, Grafton?s many devoted readers will share that sentiment.? The number ten. An unknown quantity. A mistake. A cross. A kiss. ?The shortest entry in Webster?s Unabridged. Derived from Greek and Latin and commonly found in science, medicine, and religion. The most graphically dramatic letter. Notoriously tricky to think xylophone.? The twenty-fourth letter in the English alphabet.Sue Grafton?s X: Perhaps her darkest and most chilling novel, it features a remorseless serial killer who leaves no trace of his crimes. Once again breaking the rules and establishing new paths, Grafton wastes little time identifying this sociopath. The test is whether Kinsey can prove her case against him before she becomes his next victim.From the Hardcover edition.</p>

This book discusses the big questions of the future of cinematography, in a cinema that is increasing preoccupied with technology and not with artistic moving images.Just as he did with &#8220;Electronic Cinematography&#8221; 30 years ago, Mathias cuts through the web of misinformation and lays out a brilliant method to gain control over new and constantly changing imaging technologies without losing sight of the valuable lessons cinematographers have taught us for over 100 years.

<p>Summary : Silver Dagger winner Giles Blunt delivers an exhilarating game of cat and mouse with a most unlikely?and likeable?pair of thievesEight years ago, Owen Maxwell was saved from a foster home by the arrival of his uncle Max from England. Once a promising Shakespearean actor, Magnus ?Max? Maxwell has since put his dramatic skills to new use: a master of disguise, a virtuoso of foreign dialects, and a performer to his core, he has become an extremely successful gentleman thief. Every summer, Max and Owen take a road trip across the United States, pulling off elaborate robberies along the way. But this year is different. Their first, dazzlingly executed summer heist captures the interest of the Subtractors.Long believed an urban myth, the Subtractors are a gang of vicious thieves who prey on other thieves. They will abduct a fellow crook known to have completed a lucrative job and proceed to ?subtract? parts of his body until he tells them where they can find the loot. ?No such creature,? </p>

<p>Summary : In a book that is part thrilling adventure, part exploration of some of the darkest secrets of the Holocaust, award-winning journalist and best-selling novelist Jonathan Freedland uncovers the extraordinary story of the first Jew to break out of Auschwitz, a man who was determined to warn the world?and pass on a truth too few were willing to hear.In April 1944, Rudolf Vrba became the first Jew to break out of Auschwitz?one of only four who ever pulled off that near-impossible feat. He did it to reveal the truth of the death camp to the world?and to warn the last Jews of Europe what fate awaited them at the end of the railway line. Against all odds, he and his fellow escapee, Fred Wetzler, climbed mountains, crossed rivers and narrowly missed German bullets until they had smuggled out the first full account of Auschwitz the world had ever seen?a forensically detailed report that would eventually reach Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and the Pope. And yet too few heeded the </p>

<p>Summary : A chilling medieval ghost story, retold by bestselling historian Dan Jones. Published in a beautiful small-format hardback, perfect as a Halloween read or a Christmas gift. One winter, in the dark days of King Richard II, a tailor was riding home on the road from Gilling to Ampleforth. It was dank, wet and gloomy; he couldn&#8217;t wait to get home and sit in front of a blazing fire.Then, out of nowhere, the tailor is knocked off his horse by a raven, who then transforms into a hideous dog, his mouth writhing with its own innards. The dog issues the tailor with a warning: he must go to a priest and ask for absolution and return to the road, or else there will be consequences&#8230;First recorded in the early fifteenth century by an unknown monk, The Tale of the Tailor and the Three Dead Kings was transcribed from the Latin by the great medievalist M.R. James in 1922. Building on that tradition, now bestselling historian Dan Jones retells this medieval ghost story in crisp and creepy prose.</p>

<p>Summary : Is your mother narcissistic, borderline, or just plain difficult?Are you empathetic, sensitive, and kind?Do you feel stuck in your relationship with Mom- trying to please her but never feeling good enough? Do you feel responsible for Mom&#8217;s emotional well-being? Do you struggle to set boundaries without feeling guilty or get so much pushback you end up feeling like &#8230;it&#8217;s just not worth it?If so, chances are you have fallen into one or all of the hidden psychological traps that constitute The Good Daughter Syndrome.You see, many self-aware daughters of narcissistic, borderline, or just plain difficult mothers know they need to stand up to their mothers and set healthy boundaries. Yet, they can&#8217;t bring themselves to do it, and they don&#8217;t know why. Or, they get so much pushback that they feel like it&#8217;s just not worth it.They are caught in unconscious traps they can&#8217;t see or fully understand.Trapped by their difficult mother&#8217;s needs, the empathetic daughter can&#8217;t see a way to break free </p>

<p>Summary : This textbook is a comprehensive introduction to the assessment of students in K-12 schools who use two or more languages in their daily life: English Language Learners (ELLs), or Emergent Bilinguals. The book includes a thorough examination of the policy, history and assessment/measurement issues that educators should understand in order to best advocate for their students. The author presents a decision-making framework called PUMI (Purpose, Use, Method, Instrument) that practitioners can use to better inform assessment decisions for bilingual children. The book will be an invaluable resource in teacher preparation programs, but will also help policy-makers and educators make better decisions to support their students.</p>

<p>Summary : ?The whole thing was basically an experiment,? Richard Feynman said late in his career, looking back on the origins of his lectures. The experiment turned out to be hugely successful, spawning publications that have remained definitive and introductory to physics for decades. Ranging from the basic principles of Newtonian physics through such formidable theories as general relativity and quantum mechanics, Feynman?s lectures stand as a monument of clear exposition and deep insight.Timeless and collectible, the lectures are essential reading, not just for students of physics but for anyone seeking an introduction to the field from the inimitable Feynman.</p>

<p>Summary : With a new introduction by Jim Hutton?s co-writer Tim Wapshott, Mercury and Me is the story of rock?s oddest couple. The relationship between Freddie Mercury and Jim Hutton evolved over several months in 1984 and 1985. Even when they first slept together Hutton had no idea who Mercury was, and when the star told him his name it meant nothing to him. Hutton worked as a barber at the Savoy Hotel and retained his job and his lodgings in Sutton, Surrey, for two years after moving in with Mercury, and then worked as his gardener. He was never fully assimilated into Mercury&#8217;s jet-setting lifestyle, nor did he want to be, but from 1985 until Mercury&#8217;s death in 1991 he was closer to him than anyone and knew all Mercury&#8217;s closest friends: the other members of Queen, Elton John, David Bowie and Phil Collins to name a few. Ever present at the countless Sunday lunch gatherings and opulent parties, Hutton has a wealth of anecdotes as well as a deep understanding of, Mercury&#8217;s life. He also nursed </p>

<p>Summary : To Arabella Tallant, the eldest daughter of a penniless country clergyman, the invitation to stay with her London godmother was like the key to heaven, for in addition to living in the glamorous city, Arabella might even find a suitable husband there. Armed with beauty, virtue and a benevolent godmother, the impetuous but impoverished Arabella embarked on her first London season with her mother&#8217;s wish in mind: snare a rich husband. Impetuosity is Arabella&#8217;s only fault. When fate cast her in the path of arrogant, socially prominent Robert Beaumaris, who accused her of being another petty female after his wealth, the proud, headstrong ingenue made a most startling claim &#8212; she was an heiress! Suddenly Arabella found herself the talk of the ton and pursued by every amorous fortune hunter in London and some of the most eligible young men of the day.But only one caught Arabella&#8217;s fancy: Mr Beaumaris, the handsome and dedicated bachelor. She should know better than to allow herself to be </p>

Someone who can entertain them, amuse them, fit in with their corporate schedule. And sex. They want sex. Lots of sex.Bonus, right? One major dose of epic win. Of course, guys like Carl and Rick have their conditions. One being that they come together, or not at all. Hell, I can live with that.And there are no skeletons in their designer closet, none that I can find. Just two hot sugar daddies, with particular tastes, nothing to worry about.Until Carl and Rick spill the big one, the one that sends the girls running. A whole string of them before me, running to the hills without so much as a backward glance. Maybe I should run, too. Thanks but no thanks, see you around, guys, nice knowing you. But I?m already in way too deep for that. Warning ? as </p>

<p>Summary : ?One day, we?ll be dead, and we still won?t have known each other. Not properly. Because no one ever does.?  When Catherine learns that she is dying, she remembers the words her husband once jokingly uttered and decides to leave him the ultimate, posthumous gift: a time capsule containing photographs of their life together along with tape recordings in which she recounts every secret she ever kept, every unspoken thought whether loving or treacherous; the things they never said.  Catherine?s recordings shake up many of Sean?s beliefs, sometimes enraging him and other times soothing with memories of the many joys that make up a life together.  But even as the tapes provide an emotional roller coaster of surprises, Sean prays that they?ll confirm the one thing he always secretly believed but never dared say out loud: that destiny exists; that their life together was not the result of mere chance.</p>

<p>Summary : The story of democratic failure is usually read at the level of the nation, while the primary bulwarks of democratic functioning?the states?get overlooked. This is a tale of India?s states, of why they build schools but do not staff them with teachers; favour a handful of companies so much that others slip into losses; wage water wars with their neighbours while allowing rampant sand mining and groundwater extraction; harness citizens? right to vote but brutally crack down on their right to dissent. Reporting from six states over thirty-three months, award-winning investigative journalist M. Rajshekhar delivers a necessary account of a deep crisis that has gone largely unexamined.</p>

This is a tale of India?s states, of why they build schools but do not staff them with teachers; favour a handful of companies so much that others slip into losses; wage water wars with their neighbours while allowing rampant sand mining and groundwater extraction; harness citizens? right to vote but brutally crack down on their right to dissent.

<p>Summary : I was born in Pachuca, the Beautiful Windy City, with four premature teeth and my body completely covered in a very fine coat of fuzz. But I&#8217;m grateful for that inauspicious start because ugliness, as my other uncle, Eur?pides L?pez S?nchez, was given to saying, is character forming.Highway is a late-in-life world traveler, yarn spinner, collector, and legendary auctioneer. His most precious possessions are the teeth of the &#8220;notorious infamous&#8221; like Plato, Petrarch, and Virginia Woolf. Written in collaboration with the workers at a Jumex juice factory, Teeth is an elegant, witty, exhilarating romp through the industrial suburbs of Mexico City and Luiselli&#8217;s own literary influences.</p>

<p>Summary : From two Toyota insiders&#8211;a practical, proven formula for developing a successful Lean culture in any organizationIn 1986, Toyota opened a factory in rural Kentucky and unveiled TPS, its revolutionary management system. While most manufacturers and organizations now use Lean methods, the application is almost always superficial and confined within existing management frameworks. Consequently, the groundbreaking transformation that allowed Toyota to flourish against incredible odds has rarely been replicated.Toyota&#8217;s Engagement Equation is a valuable guide to developing a Lean culture that is practical, compelling, and truly reflective of Toyota&#8217;s unique approach. The authors, two Americans who worked at the Kentucky facility and were trained by Japanese mentors, present an accessible method for replicating Toyota&#8217;s success in any organization. Step by step, you&#8217;ll learn how to internalize Toyota&#8217;s principles and successfully assimilate them into your daily work.Highlights:- A </p>

<p>Summary : In 2020, America was hit by three waves of catastrophe: the Covid-19 pandemic, widespread racial violence, and a stolen presidential election, leading to economic devastation, explosions of black crime and white flight in diverse cities, and a government crippled by deep polarization and the stench of illegitimacy. In The Year America Died, Greg Johnson comments on these crises and explains how they can be used to promote white identity politics.The crises of 2020 are opportunities for white identitarians, but in many ways, the movement is unable to capitalize on them due to bad ideas, bad organization, and bad actors. Thus the book ends on a self-critical note, with essays on the pathologies of the White Nationalist movement, including terrorism, accelerationism, paranoia, misogyny, injustice, embitterment, putting personalities above principles, and other follies.</p>

<p>Summary : </p>
<p>    In the early fall of 1897, yellow fever shuttered businesses, paralyzed trade, and caused tens of thousand of people living in the southern United States to abandon their homes and flee for their lives. Originating in Cuba, the deadly plague inspired disease-control measures that not only protected U.S. trade interests but also justified the political and economic domination of the island nation from which the pestilence came. By focusing on yellow fever, Epidemic Invasions uncovers for the first time how the devastating power of this virus profoundly shaped the relationship between the two countries.? <br />

    Yellow fever in Cuba, Mariola Espinosa demonstrates, motivated the United States to declare war against Spain in 1898, and, after the war was won and the disease eradicated, the United States demanded that Cuba pledge in its new constitution to maintain the sanitation standards established during the occupation. By situating the history of the fight against yellow </p>

<p>Summary : A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, a cruiser transporting precious cargo for the traitorous Count Dooku?s during the Clone Wars crashed into the Sea of Sand on the planet Ponemah, leaving its treasures buried. Years later, Captain Sidon Ithano, known as the Crimson Corsair, and his pirate crew receive a signal from the downed cruiser. The pirates set off after whatever lies beneath the sand, but the hidden ship?s signal has gone far and wide. Can the Crimson Corsair find the buried treasure before his rivals?</p>

<p>Summary : When Mr. Gumpy decides to go for a ride in his bright-red car, everyone wants to come along &#8212; a rabbit, a cat, a dog, a sheep, chickens, a calf, a goat, and a boy and girl. &#8220;All right,&#8221; says Mr. Gumpy. &#8220;But it will be a squash.&#8221; So they all squash in and, for a while, chug along happily. Then it starts to rain, and the car becomes stuck in the mud. Who will help Mr. Gumpy push the car out? &#8220;Not me,&#8221; says each passenger. In the end, however, they all have to help, and a wonderful time is had by all.John Burningham, twice winner of the Kate Greenaway Medal for his outstanding illustrations, has written a simple story of delightfully understated humor and illustrated it in his most enchanting style.</p>

<p>Summary : Nel terzo romanzo della trilogia di Tolkien, Aragorn e i suoi amici giungono a Gondor, relitto dell&#8217;antico Regno degli Uomini: ? il mondo del Bene, in piena decadenza. Mentre Frodo e Sam riprendono il difficile cammino verso Monte Fato, nelle pianure presso la capitale di Gondor si scontrano le forze del Bene e del Male. Quando il Male sembra avere il sopravvento, Frodo riesce a far cadere l&#8217;Anello nel cratere di Monte Fato. In quel momento l&#8217;Occhio malefico, che ha continuato a fissare il mondo, si chiude e una gran pace scende sulle cose. La Compagnia dell&#8217;Anello si riunisce e gli Hobbit ritornano a casa, incontrando ancora qualche traccia del Male&#8230; Prefazione alla seconda edizione inglese di J. R. R. Tolkien.</p>

Mentre Frodo e Sam riprendono il difficile cammino verso Monte Fato, nelle pianure presso la capitale di Gondor si scontrano le forze del Bene e del Male. Quando il Male sembra avere il sopravvento, Frodo riesce a far cadere l&#8217;Anello nel cratere di Monte Fato. In quel momento l&#8217;Occhio malefico, che ha continuato a fissare il mondo, si chiude e una gran pace scende sulle cose. La Compagnia dell&#8217;Anello si riunisce e gli Hobbit ritornano a casa, incontrando ancora qualche traccia del Male&#8230; Prefazione alla seconda edizione inglese di J. R. R. Tolkien.</p>

<p>Summary : In this epic history of extermination and survival, Timothy Snyder presents a new explanation of the great atrocity of the twentieth century, and reveals the risks that we face in the twenty-first.? Based on new sources from eastern Europe and forgotten testimonies from Jewish survivors, Black Earth recounts the mass murder of the Jews as an event that is still close to us, more comprehensible than we would like to think, and thus all the more terrifying.? ????? The Holocaust began in a dark but accessible place, in Hitler&#8217;s mind, with the thought that the elimination of Jews would restore balance to the planet and allow Germans to win the resources they desperately needed.? Such a worldview could be realized only if Germany destroyed other states, so Hitler&#8217;s aim was a colonial war in Europe itself.?

<p>Summary : Examining new genres from the UK and across the Atlantic, including mumble rap, Brooklyn drill, UK drill, trap dancehall and Afrobeats, Neon Screams explores the dystopias and dissociative transcendence offered by this boundary-pushing music.With a foreword by Simon Reynolds, Neon Screams explores the plethora of new street genres that have emerged at the turn of the 2020s. Neon Screams is a manifesto, a rallying cry for the new musical futurism. Taking street music?s embrace of Auto-Tune in the late 2000s as his starting point, Kit Mackintosh launches you through a whirlwind tour of the last decade of cutting-edge music, championing the modern genres still uncovering the sonic impossible, from mumble rap to drill to Afrobeats, bashment and beyond. Beginning where most future music chronicles end, Mackintosh establishes a new pantheon of pioneers and innovators. Offering dizzying insights into the likes of Future, Young Thug, Migos and Vybz Kartel, Neon Screams is conceptual weaponry </p>

<p>Summary : The hunger for authenticity guides us throughout our lives. People strive for joined-up living, where on the one hand what they say and do reflects what they think and feel, and on the other what they think and feel reflects who they are.Stephen Joseph has pioneered developments in research into authenticity, drawing on the solid science of positive psychology to develop what has become one of the gold-standard tests for assessing authenticity. His and others&#8217; findings reveal that when people are in relationships in which they feel accepted, understood and valued, they drop their defences. They naturally begin to examine themselves psychologically, accommodate new information and live more authentically. What&#8217;s more, the latest studies reveal that it is authenticity that leads to true happiness.In Authentic, Stephen Joseph presents his fresh and inspiring perspective on the psychology of authenticity alongside practical advice and exercises for the reader.

Or, a nomad as some choose to call me.My father took one look at me the night I shifted for the first time, and he knew I wasn?t his. I was an abomination, meant to be executed.Whatever. I know how to survive on my own, and I have been doing just fine for the past three years, even though the alpha of the Aeris pack seems set on being the one to protect me.Can?t he see that I don?t need him, even though he did save me when I was near death?His promises to lay down his life for mine don?t matter, though. I don?t belong with his pack. I don?t belong anywhere.Fantastical world building, wolf shifters, and fated mates! Abigail Grant creates adventures of fantasy, epic romance and all things paranormal. Enemies to lovers readers delight! This series is not reverse harem, and is appropriate for Young Adults, College age, and NA!Readers of K.F. Breene, Ilona Andrews, Kelly St. Claire, Elizabeth Briggs, Linsey </p>

<p>Summary : This is the age of storm and murder.After the old gods warred and drove themselves to extinction, the cataclysm of their fall shattered the land of Vigrio.Now, power-hungry jarls carve out petty kingdoms, and monsters stalk the shadow-haunted woods and mountains. A world where the bones of the dead gods still hold great power, promising fame and fortune for those brave &#8211; or desperate &#8211; enough to seek them out.As whispers of war echo over the plains and across the fjords, fate follows the footsteps of three people: a huntress searching for her missing son, a jarl&#8217;s daughter who has rejected privilege in pursuit of battle fame, and a thrall who has cast off his chains and now fights alongside the famed mercenaries known as the Bloodsworn.All three will shape the fate of the world, as it once more teeters on the edge of chaos.</p>

<p>Summary : Rethinking Fashion Globalization is a timely call to rewrite the fashion system and push back against Eurocentric dominance within fashion histories by presenting new models, approaches and understandings of fashion from critical thinkers at the forefront of decolonial fashion discourse.This edited collection draws together original, diverse, and richly reflective critiques of the fashion system from both established and emerging fashion scholars, researchers and creative practitioners. Chapters straddle current calls for decolonization and inclusion, as well as reflections on de-westernization, post-colonialism, sustainability, transnationalism, national identities, social activism, global fashion narratives, diversity, and more. The volume is divided into three key themes, &#8216;Disruptions in Time and Space&#8217;, &#8216;Nationalism and Transnationalism&#8217; and &#8216;Global Design Practices&#8217;. These themes re-map fashion&#8217;s origins, practices and futures, to present alternatives for reclaiming and </p>

<p>Summary : Lily no siempre lo ha tenido f?cil, pero eso nunca le ha impedido luchar por la vida que quiere y ha recorrido un largo camino para llegar donde est? ahora. Su vida comienza a cambiar el d?a que Ryle Kincaid, un extraordinario neurocirujano, se fija en ella. Ryle es asertivo, terco, tal vez incluso un poco arrogante, pero tambi?n es sensible, tremendamente atractivo, brillante, y tiene una debilidad total por ella. Todo en ?l es perfecto salvo su completa aversi?n a las relaciones, as? que cuando Lily se de cuenta de que ella es la excepci?n a su regla de ?no tener citas?, no puede evitar preguntarse por qu? ha tomado esa decisi?n.A medida que las preguntas sobre su nueva relaci?n la asaltan, tambi?n lo hacen los pensamientos sobre Atlas Corrigan, su primer amor y un v?nculo con el pasado que dej? atr?s. ?l era su alma gemela, su protector. Cuando Atlas reaparece repentinamente y Ryle comienza a mostrar su verdadera cara, todo lo que Lily ha construido con ?l se ve amenazado.</p>

<p>Summary : He?s my twisted nightmare. And my most depraved fantasy. He was sent to kill me on my twentieth birthday. Instead, the beautiful monster with the lethal blue eyes takes me. Kidnapped to the woods, the hauntingly gorgeous man shrouded in mystery, scars, and savagery doesn?t want my blood. He doesn?t want a ransom from the powerful Bratva family I?m the only heir to. He only wants me to run. And he wants to chase. Dark woods. Dark games. Dark desires. But the deeper I sink into our sinful fantasies, the more I realize, my domineering captor isn?t playing games at all. He?s playing for keeps. And I?m the prize. The Hunter King is a dark Bratva book. Readers are advised to read the TW inside. This is book one in a two-part duet. The completed duet includes a HEA.</p>

But the deeper I sink into our sinful fantasies, the more I realize, my domineering captor isn?t playing games at all. He?s playing for keeps. And I?m the prize. The Hunter King is a dark Bratva book. Readers are advised to read the TW inside. This is book one in a two-part duet. The completed duet includes a HEA.</p>

<p>Summary : China is home to half of the world&#8217;s large dams and adds dozens more each year. The benefits are considerable: dams deliver hydropower, provide reliable irrigation water, protect people and farmland against flooding, and produce hydroelectricity in a nation with a seeimingly insatiable appetite for energy. As hydropower responds to a larger share of energy demand, dams may also help to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels, welcome news in a country where air and water pollution have become dire and greenhouse gas emissions are the highest in the world.Yet the advantages of dams come at a high cost for river ecosystems and for the social and economic well-being of local people, who face displacement and farmland loss. This book examines the array of water-management decisions faced by Chinese leaders and their consequences for local communities.

<p>Summary : <br />
  An independent young woman shouldering a heavy burden&#8230; <br />
Ever since her parents died in a tragic train wreck, Sofia Rogers has worked a job, managed a household, and brought up her little brother, Andy&#8211;all on her own, because she prizes her independence. But that&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s been an easy road. As if she didn&#8217;t have enough burdens to bear, through circumstances beyond her control, Sofie gets pregnant&#8211;and becomes an overnight pariah. Worse than the whispers and stares of others is the bewilderment she feels, knowing she may not be able to provide for her baby. <br />
  An ambitious young doctor with lofty aspirations&#8230; <br />
Dr. Elijah Trent moved to Wabash to take over the medical practice of his grandfather, &#8220;Doc&#8221; Trent, as he is affectionately called by the locals. Moved by a sense of compassion, Eli maintains a hectic schedule, striving to meet all his patients&#8217; needs. Just when he feels as if he&#8217;s bitten off a bit more than he can chew, he meets Sofie Rogers&#8211;and his world is </p>

<p>Summary : For centuries, travel was an important part of a gardener&#8217;s initial and continuing professional training. Educational journeys to parks and gardens at home and abroad were consistently recorded in lengthy reports and articles for professional journals. The travel report by Hans Jancke (1850-1920), a court gardener who served the Prussian kings in Potsdam, Germany, is typical of this genre. Jancke&#8217;s manuscript, which until now remained unpublished, describes his 1874-1875 apprenticeship at Knowsley, the seat of the Earl of Derby near Liverpool, England. Containing extensive plant lists and detailed descriptions of the horticultural regimens observed in the estate&#8217;s kitchen gardens and greenhouses, the text is augmented by several measured drawings executed by Jancke. These illustrations include the hothouses used for fruit forcing, vegetable production, and exotic ornamentals, as well as a site plan based on Jancke&#8217;s own survey data.

<p>Summary : Britain fought three major wars, and two minor ones, with the Asante people of West Africa in the nineteenth century. Only the Sudanese and Zulu campaigns saw a greater loss of life, both for the British and the indigenous population. Like the Zulus, the Asante were a warrior nation who offered a tough adversary for the British regulars &#8211; they were respected for their martial skills and bravery. And yet these wars have rarely been written about and are little understood. That is why Stephen Manning&#8217;s vivid, detailed new history of this neglected colonial conflict is of such value.In the war of 1823-6 the British were defeated &#8211; the British governor&#8217;s head was severed and his skull was taken to the Asante king who made a cast of gold and this trophy was paraded once a year during an Asante ceremony.

<p>Summary : Britain fought three major wars, and two minor ones, with the Asante people of West Africa in the nineteenth century. Only the Sudanese and Zulu campaigns saw a greater loss of life, both for the British and the indigenous population. Like the Zulus, the Asante were a warrior nation who offered a tough adversary for the British regulars &#8211; they were respected for their martial skills and bravery. And yet these wars have rarely been written about and are little understood. That is why Stephen Manning&#8217;s vivid, detailed new history of this neglected colonial conflict is of such value.In the war of 1823-6 the British were defeated &#8211; the British governor&#8217;s head was severed and his skull was taken to the Asante king who made a cast of gold and this trophy was paraded once a year during an Asante ceremony. The years 1873-4 witnessed the brilliance of Sir Garnet Wolseley in overcoming the logistical problems of sending a large British expedition deep into the jungle where it faced not only a </p>

<p>Summary : On Earth We&#8217;re Briefly Gorgeous is a letter from a son to a mother who cannot read. Written when the speaker, Little Dog, is in his late twenties, the letter unearths a family&#8217;s history that began before he was born ? a history whose epicenter is rooted in Vietnam ? and serves as a doorway into parts of his life his mother has never known, all of it leading to an unforgettable revelation. At once a witness to the fraught yet undeniable love between a single mother and her son, it is also a brutally honest exploration of race, class, and masculinity. Asking questions central to our American moment, immersed as we are in addiction, violence, and trauma, but undergirded by compassion and tenderness, On Earth We&#8217;re Briefly Gorgeous is as much about the power of telling one&#8217;s own story as it is about the obliterating silence of not being heard.With stunning urgency and grace, Ocean Vuong writes of people caught between disparate worlds, and asks how we heal and rescue one another without </p>

<p>Summary : The paths of Roboute Guilliman and his fallen brother Mortarion bring them inexorably together on Iax. Once a jewel of the Imperium, the garden world is dying as the plans of the Lord of Death to use it as a fulcrum to drag the stellar realm of Ultramar into the warp come to deadly fruition. While Guilliman attempts to prevent the destruction of his kingdom, Mortarion schemes to bring his brother low with the Godblight, a disease created in the Cauldron of Nurgle itself, made with the power to destroy a son of the Emperor.Read by John banks</p>
