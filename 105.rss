In the Land of This and That, there are only two kinds: blue bunnies and yellow birds. But one day a funny green egg hatches, and a little creature that&#8217;s not quite a bird and not quite a bunny pops out. It&#8217;s neither! Neither tries hard to fit in, but its bird legs aren&#8217;t good for jumping like the other bunnies, and its fluffy tail isn&#8217;t good for flapping like the other birds. It sets out to find a new home and discovers a very different place, one with endless colors and shapes and creatures of all kinds. But when a blue bunny and a yellow bird with some hidden differences of their own arrive, it&#8217;s up to Neither to decide if they are welcome in the Land of All.

<p>Summary : Memories are never forgotten.Or so it?s said, but she did. She forgot herself, me, and us. She forgot everything. One day I woke up and there was only pain. This pain is so fierce that I can?t overcome it alone. My heart was ripped from my chest and I?m surviving, but barely. Not even the physical outlet I seek to purge the torment of remembering the one I can?t let go helps anymore.In all of his agony what if the worst of his pain has yet to be expelled; a secret that could have changed everything had he known. Every day that I wake up I?m in a fog.Before ten years ago I feel like I didn?t exist. Everything I ever knew had been erased. Some days I wish I had bad memories because even those are better than none at all. Instead, I feel like I?m a character in a storybook, merely acting a role. I don?t know why, but none of it feels real. That?s crazy, right? Still, I can?t shake the feeling that everyone is hiding something from me. Even the man that lies next to me at night sometimes </p>

<p>Summary : Simon Snow ? il peggior prescelto di sempre. Questo ? ci? che sostiene Baz, il suo compagno di stanza. Baz potr? anche essere un vampiro e un nemico, ma ha probabilmente ragione. Per la maggior parte del tempo infatti Simon non sa far funzionare la sua bacchetta, oppure non sa controllare il suo inestinguibile potere mandando tutto a fuoco. Il suo mentore lo evita, la sua ragazza lo ha lasciato, e un mostro con la sua faccia si aggira per Watford, la scuola di magia in cui frequentano l&#8217;ultimo anno. Allora perch? Baz non riesce a fare a meno di stargli sempre intorno?</p>

<p>Summary : Mark Galeotti, uno de los mayores expertos en la Rusia contempor?nea, analiza en este oportuno libro c?mo Vlad?mir Putin ha remodelado su pa?s a trav?s de toda la serie de intervenciones militares en que se ha implicado, que incluye la devastadora invasi?n de Ucrania.Las guerras de Putin dibuja una visi?n general de los conflictos en los que Rusia se ha visto envuelta desde que Putin se convirtiese en primer ministro, y luego en presidente, desde la Primera Guerra de Chechenia hasta las dos incursiones militares en Georgia, su pol?mica intervenci?n en la guerra civil Siria, la anexi?n de Crimea y la eventual invasi?n de la propia Ucrania. Pero tambi?n examina de forma m?s amplia la renovaci?n del poder militar ruso y su evoluci?n con el fin de incluir una serie de nuevas capacidades, que van desde el empleo de mercenarios hasta su implacable guerra de informaci?n contra occidente. Galeotti, con aguda visi?n estrat?gica, se?ala las fortalezas y debilidades de un Ej?rcito ruso </p>

<p>Summary : Mark Galeotti, uno de los mayores expertos en la Rusia contempor?nea, analiza en este oportuno libro c?mo Vlad?mir Putin ha remodelado su pa?s a trav?s de toda la serie de intervenciones militares en que se ha implicado, que incluye la devastadora invasi?n de Ucrania.Las guerras de Putin dibuja una visi?n general de los conflictos en los que Rusia se ha visto envuelta desde que Putin se convirtiese en primer ministro, y luego en presidente, desde la Primera Guerra de Chechenia hasta las dos incursiones militares en Georgia, su pol?mica intervenci?n en la guerra civil Siria, la anexi?n de Crimea y la eventual invasi?n de la propia Ucrania. Pero tambi?n examina de forma m?s amplia la renovaci?n del poder militar ruso y su evoluci?n con el fin de incluir una serie de nuevas capacidades, que van desde el empleo de mercenarios hasta su implacable guerra de informaci?n contra occidente.

<p>Summary : A concise and authoritative introduction to one of the central theories of modern physicsFor a theory as genuinely elegant as the Standard Model&#8211;the current framework describing elementary particles and their forces&#8211;it can sometimes appear to students to be little more than a complicated collection of particles and ranked list of interactions. The Standard Model in a Nutshell provides a comprehensive and uncommonly accessible introduction to one of the most important subjects in modern physics, revealing why, despite initial appearances, the entire framework really is as elegant as physicists say.Dave Goldberg uses a just-in-time approach to instruction that enables students to gradually develop a deep understanding of the Standard Model even if this is their first exposure to it. He covers everything from relativity, group theory, and relativistic quantum mechanics to the Higgs boson, unification schemes, and physics beyond the Standard Model. The book also looks at new avenues of </p>

<p>Summary : Defend yourself and protect your assets in a lair that feels as real and alive as your monsters with advice from Keith Ammann, author of The Monsters Know What They?re Doing: Combat Tactics for Dungeon Masters. The world is a dangerous place?especially when you?re up to no good. Whether you?re a rampaging monster, a renowned hero, or the current possessor of the Golden MacGuffin, someone?s going to come at you. Probably more than one someone. You need to be ready. You need a lair. In How to Defend Your Lair, gamemaster Keith Ammann pulls back the curtain on an underrated but crucial part of any tabletop roleplaying game: drawing the maps. Say goodbye to encounters between PCs and baddies in randomly generated dungeons and hello to a game in which where the fight takes place is just as important as the fight itself. This book teaches you how to use real-world principles of building security and area defense to create strongholds infused with flavor, informed by narrative, and complex </p>

<p>Summary : Rocket science is no problem. Falling in love, on the other hand?College student Melody Gage is craving a night of no-strings fun when she meets charming out-of-towner Jeremy, and that?s exactly what she gets. Until three years later, when Melody relocates to Los Angeles and finds herself thrust back into Jeremy?s orbit. Not only does her hunky one-night stand work at the same aerospace company where she?s just started her dream job, he?s the CEO?s son. Jeremy?s got a girlfriend and a reputation as a bad boy, so Melody resolves to keep her distance. Despite her good intentions, a series of awkward circumstances?including an embarrassing crying jag, a latte vs. computer catastrophe, and an emergency fake date?throw her together with the heavenly-smelling paragon of hotness. As the billionaire playboy and nerdy IT girl forge an unlikely friendship, Melody?s attraction to Jeremy grows deeper than she?s ready to admit. Will she risk it all for a shot at her happy ending?The debut novel </p>

<p>Summary : How do you get your dinner? That is the basic question of economics. It might seem easy, but it is actually very complicated.When Adam Smith proclaimed that all our actions were motivated by self-interest and the world turned because of financial gain he laid the foundations for &#8216;economic man&#8217;. Selfish and cynical, &#8216;economic man&#8217; has dominated our thinking ever since, the ugly rational heart of modern day capitalism. But every night Adam Smith&#8217;s mother served him his dinner, not out of self-interest, but out of love.Even today, the unpaid work of mothering, caring, cleaning and cooking is not part of our economic models. All over the world, there are economists who believe that if women are paid less, then that&#8217;s because their labour is worth less.In this engaging, popular look at the mess we&#8217;re in, Katrine Mar?al charts the myth of &#8216;economic man&#8217;, from its origins at Adam Smith&#8217;s dinner table to its adaptation by the Chicago School and finally its disastrous role in the 2008 Global </p>

<p>Summary : When Dorothy triumphed over the Wicked Witch of the West in L. Frank Baum&#8217;s classic tale, we heard only her side of the story. But what about her arch-nemesis, the mysterious witch? Where did she come from? How did she become so wicked? And what is the true nature of evil?  Gregory Maguire creates a fantasy world so rich and vivid that we will never look at Oz the same way again. Wicked is about a land where animals talk and strive to be treated like first-class citizens, Munchkinlanders seek the comfort of middle-class stability and the Tin Man becomes a victim of domestic violence. And then there is the little green-skinned girl named Elphaba, who will grow up to be the infamous Wicked Witch of the West, a smart, prickly and misunderstood creature who challenges all our preconceived notions about the nature of good and evil.</p>

<p>Summary : Semasa jaya Majapahit, Nusantara merupakan kesatuan maritim dan kerajaan laut terbesar di antara bangsa-bangsa beradab di muka bumi. Arus bergerak dari selatan ke utara, segalanya: kapal-kapalnya, manusianya, amal perbuatannya dan cita-citanya, semuanya bergerak dari Nusantara di selatan ke atas angin di utara. Tetapi jaman berubah&#8230;.Arus berbalik &#8211; bukan lagi dari selatan ke utara tetapi sebaliknya dari utara ke selatan. Utara menguasai selatan, menguasai urat nadi kehidupan Nusantara&#8230; perpecahan dan kekalahan demi kekalahan seakan menjadi bagian dari Jawa yang beruntun tiada hentinya.Wiranggaleng &#8211; pemuda desa sederhana, menjadi tokoh protagonis dalam epos kepahlawanan yang maha dasyat ini. Dia bertarung sampai ke pusat Portugis di Malaka, memberi segala-galanya -walau hanya secauk pasir sekalipun- untuk membendung arus utara.Masih dapatkah arus balik membalik lagi?</p>

<p>Summary : Semasa jaya Majapahit, Nusantara merupakan kesatuan maritim dan kerajaan laut terbesar di antara bangsa-bangsa beradab di muka bumi. Arus bergerak dari selatan ke utara, segalanya: kapal-kapalnya, manusianya, amal perbuatannya dan cita-citanya, semuanya bergerak dari Nusantara di selatan ke atas angin di utara. Tetapi jaman berubah&#8230;.Arus berbalik &#8211; bukan lagi dari selatan ke utara tetapi sebaliknya dari utara ke selatan. Utara menguasai selatan, menguasai urat nadi kehidupan Nusantara&#8230; perpecahan dan kekalahan demi kekalahan seakan menjadi bagian dari Jawa yang beruntun tiada hentinya.Wiranggaleng &#8211; pemuda desa sederhana, menjadi tokoh protagonis dalam epos kepahlawanan yang maha dasyat ini. Dia bertarung sampai ke pusat Portugis di Malaka, memberi segala-galanya -walau hanya secauk pasir sekalipun- untuk membendung arus utara.Masih dapatkah arus balik membalik lagi?</p>

Chiara Frugoni, uno dei maggiori medievisti italiani, che crea un dizionario ideale del Medioevo con lievit? e humour rispondendo a tante curiosit? implicite o esplicite poste dalle nostre esperienze quotidiane di oggetti, usanze e modi di dire.</p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  I&#8217;ll never forget the first time I saw them, warriors moving like shadows from the trees. Their eyes seemed to glow with a fierce golden light, moving more like beasts than men. I trembled, every hair on my flesh prickled in the age old response of the hunted. They were predators and I was prey! <br />
  They entered the clearing and brought with them the smell of blood. Clad in furs and leather, bristling with weapons, they were warriors the likes of which I&#8217;d never seen. Huge, hulking forms, dark shapes pricked with those glowing pairs of eyes&#8230;</p>
<p>      I could not face them properly, for I was bound to a tree, in the middle of a wilderness, helpless as I waited to be sold to the Berserkers&#8230;</p>
<p>  When Brenna&#8217;s father sells her to a band of passing warriors, her only thought is to survive. She doesn&#8217;t expect to be claimed by the two fearsome warriors who lead the Berserker clan. Kept in captivity, she is coddled and cared for, treated more like a savior than a slave. Can </p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  Previously titled: &#8216;The Rust Country&#8217;. <br />
From the author of The Watchmaker of Filigree Street and The Kingdoms, an epic Cold War novel set in a mysterious town in Soviet Russia.In 1963, in a Siberian gulag, former nuclear specialist Valery Kolkhanov has mastered what it takes to survive: the right connections to the guards for access to food and cigarettes, the right pair of warm boots to avoid frostbite, and the right attitude toward the small pleasures of life so he won?t go insane.

But as Valery begins his work, he is struck by the questions his research raises: </p>

<p>Summary : Librarian&#8217;s note: An alternate cover edition can be found hereFour women-four friends-share a determination to stop a killer who has been stalking newlyweds in San Francisco. Each one holds a piece of the puzzle: Lindsay Boxer is a homicide inspector in the San Francisco Police Department, Claire Washburn is a medical examiner, Jill Bernhardt is an assistant D.A., and Cindy Thomas just started working the crime desk of the San Francisco Chronicle.But the usual procedures aren&#8217;t bringing them any closer to stopping the killings. So these women form a Women&#8217;s Murder Club to collaborate outside the box and pursue the case by sidestepping their bosses and giving one another a hand.The four women develop intense bonds as they pursue a killer whose crimes have stunned an entire city. Working together, they track down the most terrifying and unexpected killer they have ever encountered-before a shocking conclusion in which everything they knew turns out to be devastatingly wrong.</p>

Each one holds a piece of the puzzle: Lindsay Boxer is a homicide inspector in the San Francisco Police Department, Claire Washburn is a medical examiner, Jill Bernhardt is an assistant D.A., and Cindy Thomas just started working the crime desk of the San Francisco Chronicle.But the usual procedures aren&#8217;t bringing them any closer to stopping the killings. So these women form a Women&#8217;s Murder Club to collaborate outside the box and pursue the case by sidestepping their bosses and giving one another a hand.The four women develop intense bonds as they pursue a killer whose crimes have stunned an entire city. Working together, they track down the most terrifying and unexpected killer they have ever encountered-before a shocking conclusion in which everything they knew turns out to be devastatingly wrong.</p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;Some guys don&#8217;t break any rules. They do their jobs, they go to school, they don&#8217;t commit any infractions, they keep their cells clean and tidy, and they follow the rules. And usually those are our LWOPs [life without parole]. They&#8217;re usually our easiest keepers.&#8221;Too Easy to Keep provides much-needed attention to a neglected group of American prisoners &#8211; the large and growing population of those serving life sentences. Relying heavily on extensive interviews with lifers and with prison staff, Too Easy to Keep charts the challenges that a life sentence poses&#8211;both to the prisoner and the staffer charged with caring for them. Surprisingly, many lifers show remarkable resilience and craft lives of notable purpose. Yet their eventual decline will pose challenges for the institutions that house them. Rich in data, Too Easy to Keep illustrates the harsh consequences of excessive sentences, and demonstrates a keen need to reconsider punishment policy.</p>

<p>Summary : When Queenie Hennessy discovers that Harold Fry is walking the length of England to save her, and all she has to do is wait, she is shocked. Her note to him had explained she was dying from cancer. How can she wait?A new volunteer at the hospice suggests that Queenie should write again; only this time she must tell Harold the truth. Composing this new message, the volunteer promises, will ensure Queenie hangs on. It will also atone for the secrets of the past. As the volunteer points out, &#8216;It isn&#8217;t Harold who is saving you. It is you, saving Harold Fry.&#8217;This is that letter. A letter that was never sent.Told in simple, emotionally-honest prose, with a mischievous bite, this is a novel about the journey we all must take to learn who we are; it is about loving and letting go. And most of all it is about finding joy in unexpected places and at times we least expect.Queenie thought her first letter would be the end of the story. She was wrong. It was just the beginning&#8230;</p>

<p>Summary : Hood Rat (n.): A woman of questionable repute, one who has been known to &#8220;get around&#8221; in the &#8216;hood. Yoshi is young, fine, and larcenous. She lives her life playing on men&#8217;s hearts as well as their pockets. She learns the hard way that all that glitters isn&#8217;t gold. Billy, a former high school basketball star, is at the end of her rope with the opposite sex. To her, all men are dogs, so she secretly seeks comfort in the arms of women, until she meets a man who makes her reevaluate her feelings.

<p>Summary : Hood Rat (n.): A woman of questionable repute, one who has been known to &#8220;get around&#8221; in the &#8216;hood. Yoshi is young, fine, and larcenous. She lives her life playing on men&#8217;s hearts as well as their pockets. She learns the hard way that all that glitters isn&#8217;t gold. Billy, a former high school basketball star, is at the end of her rope with the opposite sex.

<p>Summary : Lingua coreana 1 ? un manuale adatto a chi compie i primi passi nell?apprendimento della lingua coreana. Strutturato in quattordici unit?, il testo consente di acquisire familiarit? con l?alfabeto coreano, con la fonetica della lingua e con alcune semplici forme grammaticali.?La lingua coreana ? un fenomeno in rapidissima evoluzione, un?evoluzione che sembra procedere di pari passo con lo straordinario sviluppo economico del Paese. Ne consegue, in tal modo, che il coreano insegnato nel 2014 ? diverso da quello insegnato nel 1985 o nel 1995, e questo comporta automaticamente il fatto che, insieme alla lingua, debbano essere aggiornati tutti gli strumenti didattici ad essa pertinenti. Per questo, dunque, questo testo risulta ancora pi? attuale e prezioso, capace com?? di costituire una guida agile e moderna, eppur sicura, per lo studente che oggi si appresta a studiare la lingua coreana.?

<p>Summary : An alternative cover edition for this ISBN can be found here.Yeong-hye and her husband are ordinary people. He is an office worker with moderate ambitions and mild manners; she is an uninspired but dutiful wife. The acceptable flatline of their marriage is interrupted when Yeong-hye, seeking a more &#8216;plant-like&#8217; existence, decides to become a vegetarian, prompted by grotesque recurring nightmares. In South Korea, where vegetarianism is almost unheard-of and societal mores are strictly obeyed, Yeong-hye&#8217;s decision is a shocking act of subversion. Her passive rebellion manifests in ever more bizarre and frightening forms, leading her bland husband to self-justified acts of sexual sadism. His cruelties drive her towards attempted suicide and hospitalisation. She unknowingly captivates her sister&#8217;s husband, a video artist. She becomes the focus of his increasingly erotic and unhinged artworks, while spiralling further and further into her fantasies of abandoning her fleshly prison and </p>

<p>Summary : In questo agile volume, il grande fisico Stephen Hawking delinea una breve storia dell&#8217;Universo &#8220;dal Big Bang ai buchi neri&#8221; (per citare il titolo italiano della sua opera pi? famosa). Per farlo, presenta le principali teorie cosmologiche da Aristotele fino ad Einstein, passando da Tolomeo, Copernico, Galileo e Newton; quindi espone le conoscenze attuali sulle leggi fisiche alle quali obbedisce il nostro Universo; infine, avanza alcune ipotesi in direzione di quella &#8220;teoria del tutto&#8221; capace di unificare la meccanica quantistica, la gravit? e le altre interazioni della fisica. Solo una &#8220;teoria del tutto&#8221;, infatti, ci consentirebbe di rispondere alla vera questione ultima: perch? esiste l&#8217;Universo?</p>

<p>Summary : Inside Out and Back Again meets One Crazy Summer and Brown Girl Dreaming in this novel-in-verse about fitting in and standing up for what?s rightIt&#8217;s 1969, and the Apollo 11 mission is getting ready to go to the moon. But for half-black, half-Japanese Mimi, moving to a predominantly white Vermont town is enough to make her feel alien. Suddenly, Mimi&#8217;s appearance is all anyone notices. She struggles to fit in with her classmates, even as she fights for her right to stand out by entering science competitions and joining Shop Class instead of Home Ec. And even though teachers and neighbors balk at her mixed-race family and her refusals to conform, Mimi?s dreams of becoming an astronaut never fade?no matter how many times she?s told no.This historical middle-grade novel is told in poems from Mimi&#8217;s perspective over the course of one year in her new town, and shows readers that positive change can start with just one person speaking up.</p>

<p>Summary : **Warning: This book is a wild, sexy beast of a read. 18+** Savage man, loner, warrior? I am dangerous at my core. I have lived amidst the untamed wild of the rainforest, in a society that reveres me and where every woman falls before me in subjugation.Now I?ve been discovered. Forced to return to a world that I have forgotten about and to a culture that is only vaguely familiar to my senses.Dr. Moira Reed is an anthropologist who has been hired to help me transition back into modern society. It?s her job to smooth away my rough edges? to teach me how to navigate properly through this new life of mine. She wants to tame me.She?ll never win.I am wild, free and raw, and the only thing I want from the beautiful Moira Reed is to fuck her into submission.She wants it, I am certain.I will give it to her soon.Yes, very soon, I will become the teacher and she will become my student. And when I am finished showing her body pleasure like no other, she?ll know what it feels like to be claimed </p>

<p>Summary : As each new generation of entrepreneurs emerges, there is a renewed interest in how venture capital deals come together. Yet there really is no definitive guide to venture capital deals. Nobody understands this better than authors Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson. For more than seventeen years, they&#8217;ve been involved in hundreds of venture capital financings, and now, with Venture Deals, they share their experiences in this field with you.Inspired by a series of blog posts &#8211; created by the authors after a particularly challenging deal &#8211; this reliable resource demystifies the venture capital financing process and helps you gain a practical perspective of this dynamic discipline.Whether you&#8217;re an experienced or aspiring entrepreneur, venture capitalist, or lawyer who partakes in these particular types of deals, you can benefit from the insights found throughout this book. Engaging and informative, Venture Deals skillfully outlines the essential elements of the venture capital term sheet &#8211; </p>

<p>Summary : Una familia iran? separada por la revoluci?n de 1979 se re?ne durante diez d?as en una casa de la costa de Turqu?a. La matriarca lleva casi treinta a?os sin ver a algunos de sus seis hijos, sus nietos no hablan la misma lengua, y se da cuenta de que el peso de los malentendidos y el tiempo transcurrido ha dividido profundamente a su familia: los que se han ido extra?an su tierra, mientras que los que se han quedado en ella envidian las riquezas y comodidades de las que disfrutan sus parientes en el extranjero. Despu?s de varias rencillas, advierte a sus hijos de que es hora de resta?ar las heridas antes de que la ruptura sea definitiva. Cada uno alberga reproches en su fuero interno, resentimientos nutridos por la ignorancia, la necesidad de presumir de los ?xitos o de justificar sus carencias. La madre escucha los diferentes puntos de vista, comprende tanto la nostalgia por la patria como el anhelo por la libertad, y reconcilia a los exiliados con los que nunca partieron.Parinoush </p>

<p>Summary : Una familia iran? separada por la revoluci?n de 1979 se re?ne durante diez d?as en una casa de la costa de Turqu?a. La matriarca lleva casi treinta a?os sin ver a algunos de sus seis hijos, sus nietos no hablan la misma lengua, y se da cuenta de que el peso de los malentendidos y el tiempo transcurrido ha dividido profundamente a su familia: los que se han ido extra?an su tierra, mientras que los que se han quedado en ella envidian las riquezas y comodidades de las que disfrutan sus parientes en el extranjero. Despu?s de varias rencillas, advierte a sus hijos de que es hora de resta?ar las heridas antes de que la ruptura sea definitiva. Cada uno alberga reproches en su fuero interno, resentimientos nutridos por la ignorancia, la necesidad de presumir de los ?xitos o de justificar sus carencias. La madre escucha los diferentes puntos de vista, comprende tanto la nostalgia por la patria como el anhelo por la libertad, y reconcilia a los exiliados con los que nunca partieron.Parinoush </p>

<p>Summary : Ada seorang Ibu yang dilanda dilema karena anaknya menjadi pengkhianat.Ada tukang bubut yang oleh kisah sederhana menisbatkan diri sebagai sosialis.Ada dua orang miskin menikah dan menghentak kesadaran orang.Ada seorang kakak yang keji memasukkan adiknya ke rumah sakit jiwa.Ada penggali terowongan yang meratap.Ada para pekerja kereta yang melakukan pemogokan dan meresahkan seluruh penduduk kota.Dan selalu ada potret kemanusian di setiap cerita Maxim Gorky.Kumpulan cerpen Si Tukang Onar adalah salah satu judul penting Maxim Gorky. Dalam cerita-ceritanya dipotret dengan apik perkara-perkara yang seolah remeh, tapi mampu membangkitkan kesadaran akan rasa kemanusiaan dan menyisakan gaung nyaring dalam pikiran pembaca. Sebuah karya penting yang dialihbahasakan dengan begitu apik oleh Eka Kurniawan.</p>

<p>Summary : Summer is coming to a close on Long Island, and Alex is no longer welcome.A misstep at a dinner party, and the older man she&#8217;s been staying with dismisses her with a ride to the train station and a ticket back to the city.With few resources and a waterlogged phone, but gifted with an ability to navigate the desires of others, Alex stays on Long Island and drifts like a ghost through the hedged lanes, gated driveways and sun-blasted dunes of a rarified world that is, at first, closed to her. Propelled by desperation and a mutable sense of morality, she spends the week leading up to the end of the holidays moving from one place to the next, a cipher leaving destruction in her wake.</p>

<p>Summary : Perhaps no one in the twentieth century had a greater long-term impact on world history than Deng Xiaoping. And no scholar of contemporary East Asian history and culture is better qualified than Ezra Vogel to disentangle the many contradictions embodied in the life and legacy of China?s boldest strategist.Once described by Mao Zedong as a ?needle inside a ball of cotton,? Deng was the pragmatic yet disciplined driving force behind China?s radical transformation in the late twentieth century. He confronted the damage wrought by the Cultural Revolution, dissolved Mao?s cult of personality, and loosened the economic and social policies that had stunted China?s growth. Obsessed with modernization and technology, Deng opened trade relations with the West that lifted hundreds of millions of his countrymen out of poverty. Yet at the same time he answered to his authoritarian roots, most notably when he ordered the crackdown in June 1989 at Tiananmen Square.Deng?s youthful commitment to the </p>

<p>Summary : A thoroughly updated and substantially expanded edition of an acclaimed anthologyThis is a thoroughly updated and substantially expanded new edition of one of the most popular, wide-ranging, and engaging anthologies of Western political thinking, one that spans from antiquity to the twenty-first century. In addition to the majority of the pieces that appeared in the original edition, this new edition features exciting new selections from more recent thinkers who address vital contemporary issues, including identity, cosmopolitanism, global justice, and populism. Organized chronologically, the anthology brings together a fascinating array of writings&#8211;including essays, book excerpts, speeches, and other documents&#8211;that have indelibly shaped how politics and society are understood. Each chronological section and thinker is presented with a brief, lucid introduction, making this a valuable reference as well as an essential reader.A thoroughly updated and substantially expanded edition </p>

<p>Summary : When the pioneering Taiwanese novelist Qiu Miaojin committed suicide in 1995 at age twenty-six, she left behind her unpublished masterpiece, Last Words from Montmartre. Unfolding through a series of letters written by an unnamed narrator, Last Words tells the story of a passionate relationship between two young women?their sexual awakening, their gradual breakup, and the devastating aftermath of their broken love. In a style that veers between extremes, from self-deprecation to pathos, compulsive repetition to rhapsodic musings, reticence to vulnerability, Qiu?s genre-bending novel is at once a psychological thriller, a sublime romance, and the author?s own suicide note.The letters (which, Qiu tells us, can be read in any order) leap between Paris, Taipei, and Tokyo. They display wrenching insights into what it means to live between cultures, languages, and genders?until the genderless character Zo? appears, and the narrator?s spiritual and physical identity is transformed.

I want to believe Lilly will forgive me. But once I come clean that I am not her brother and why I was forced to stay away, there&#8217;s no turning back.**AUTHOR?S NOTEThe Dark Series Trilogy is one continuous story consisting of In the Dark, Out of the Dark, and <br />

<p>Summary : Told from the perspective of biracial sixth-graders June and Tyrell,?two children living in a homeless shelter. As their friendship grows over a shared love of classical music, June and Tyrell confront a new housing policy that puts homeless families in danger. It&#8217;s June?s first day at Huey House, and as if losing her home weren?t enough, she also can?t bring her cherished viola inside. Before the accident last year, her dad saved tip money for a year to buy her viola, and she?s not about to give it up now. Tyrell has been at Huey House for three years and gives June a glimpse of the good things about living there: friendship, hot meals, and a classical musician next door. Can he and June work together to oppose the government, or will families be forced out of Huey House before they are ready?</p>

Mary narrowly escapes a similar fate, only to face intolerance and new danger among the Puritans in the New World. How long can she hide her true identity? Will she ever find a place where her healing powers will not be feared?Just two weeks after publication, Celia Rees&#8217;s WITCH CHILD spirited its way onto the Book Sense Children&#8217;s Only 76 list as one of the Top 10 books that independent booksellers like to handsell. Within a month, this riveting book sold out its first two hardcover printings. Now, Candlewick Press is pleased to announce the publication of WITCH CHILD in paperback.</p>

Lancaster to be a man. When the lovely dark-skinned Viveca introduces herself he is speechless, then wants her back on the train and out of his town.

Yet almost nothing is known of Alpharius, the most mysterious of them all, for the Lord of the Alpha Legion is unparalleled in the art of obfuscation. Such are his gifts of secrecy and deceit that even his rediscovery has remained an enigma ? until now. But when the tale comes from the serpent?s mouth, where do the lies end and the truth begin?</p>

<p>Summary : Pour la premi?re fois dans son ?uvre, Ismail Kadar? aborde, en 1969, un pan capital de l?histoire contemporaine de son pays, l?Albanie : le schisme survenu en 1960-1961 au sein du monde communiste avec, d?un c?t?

Le livre s?ouvre et se referme sur la m?me image d?une temp?te qui malm?ne les antennes sur les toits, antennes que l?on redresse apr?s la bourrasque comme si le vent de l?Histoire, en d?finitive, ?tait impuissant ? changer le cours de la vie, celle de l?homme ?ternel. Le succ?s de ce roman ? sa parution en Occident tint pour partie au tableau g?n?ral qu?il donnait du sombre Olympe du monde communiste, un Olympe d?chir? qui n?h?sitait pas ? faire couler le sang et ? r?pandre la terreur.</p>

<p>Summary : A man can?t set you free?only you can.Backstage and in front of the world, a vicious record executive rules over his kingdom and the perfect little doll he?s created. He pulls the strings and poses her under the lights, and in the cage of the public eye, she?ll remain, until one day . . . she takes flight.Where she lands, only one man will know?the one who?s being paid to watch her. He?s killer by trade, a lonesome soldier for hire. Clearly not a fan, he begrudgingly follows her. From the streets of New York to the coast of North Carolina, through the center of the country to a pot shop in Portland. The assignment is elementary and completely beneath him, until he finds himself teetering between love and obsession.The public devours her.Friends betray her.Men try to possess her.Every single one of them underestimates her.</p>

<p>Summary : A man can?t set you free?only you can.Backstage and in front of the world, a vicious record executive rules over his kingdom and the perfect little doll he?s created. He pulls the strings and poses her under the lights, and in the cage of the public eye, she?ll remain, until one day . . . she takes flight.Where she lands, only one man will know?the one who?s being paid to watch her. He?s killer by trade, a lonesome soldier for hire. Clearly not a fan, he begrudgingly follows her. From the streets of New York to the coast of North Carolina, through the center of the country to a pot shop in Portland. The assignment is elementary and completely beneath him, until he finds himself teetering between love and obsession.The public devours her.Friends betray her.Men try to possess her.Every single one of them underestimates her.</p>

<p>Summary : Assassinato e sinais misteriosos em uma trama para f?s de Stranger Things e Stephen King.Em 1986, Eddie e os amigos passam a maior parte dos dias andando de bicicleta pela pacata vizinhan?a em busca de aventuras. Os desenhos a giz s?o seu c?digo secreto: homenzinhos rabiscados no asfalto; mensagens que s? eles entendem. Mas um desenho misterioso leva o grupo de crian?as at? um corpo desmembrado e espalhado em um bosque. Depois disso, nada mais ? como antes.Em 2016, Eddie se esfor?a para superar o passado, at? que um dia ele e os amigos de inf?ncia recebem um mesmo aviso: o desenho de um homem de giz enforcado. Quando um dos amigos aparece morto, Eddie tem certeza de que precisa descobrir o que de fato aconteceu trinta anos atr?s.Alternando habilidosamente entre presente e passado, O Homem de Giz traz o melhor do suspense: personagens maravilhosamente constru?dos, mist?rios de prender o f?lego e reviravoltas que v?o impressionar at? os leitores mais escaldados.</p>

<p>Summary : In a single night?graduation night?Thomas has to do what everyone has always expected of him, or forge an entirely new path? Bryan Bliss?s absorbing examination of one boy struggling with expectations and realities will appeal to readers of Sara Zarr and Chris Crutcher.Thomas is supposed to leave for the Army in the morning. His father was Army. His brother, Jake, is Army?is a hero, even, with the medals to prove it. Everyone expects Thomas to follow in that fine tradition. But Jake came back from overseas a completely different person, and that has shaken Thomas?s certainty about his own future. And so when his long-estranged friend Mallory suggests one last night of adventure, Thomas takes her up on the distraction. Over the course of this single night, Thomas will lose, find, resolve, doubt, drive, explore, and leap off a bridge. He?ll also face the truth of his brother?s post-traumatic stress disorder and of his own courage. In Bryan Bliss?s deft hands, graduation night becomes a </p>

<p>Summary : In 1577, the Jesuit Priest Matteo Ricci set out from Italy to bring Christian faith and Western thought to Ming dynasty China. To capture the complex emotional and religious drama of Ricci&#8217;s extraordinary life, Jonathan Spence relates his subject&#8217;s experiences with several images that Ricci himself created&#8211;four images derived from the events in the bible and others from a book on the art of memory that Ricci wrote in Chinese and circulated among members of the Ming dynasty elite. A rich and compelling narrative about a remarkable life, The Memory Palace Of Matteo Ricci is also a significant work of global history, juxtaposing the world of Counter-Reformation Europe with that of Ming China.</p>

<p>Summary : The war is over, and army priest Tomas Piety heads home with Sergeant Bloody Anne at his side. But things have changed while he was away: his crime empire has been stolen and the people of Ellinburg&#8211;his people&#8211;have run out of food and hope and places to hide. Tomas sets out to reclaim what was his with help from Anne, his brother, Jochan, and his new gang: the Pious Men. But when he finds himself dragged into a web of political intrigue once again, everything gets more complicated.As the Pious Men fight shadowy foreign infiltrators in the back-street taverns, brothels, and gambling dens of Tomas&#8217;s old life, it becomes clear: The war is only just beginning.</p>

<p>Summary : Emily Joiner was once part of an inseparable group?she was a sister, a best friend, a lover, and a rival. Summers without Emily were unthinkable. Until the fire burned the lake house to ashes with her inside. A year later, it?s in Emily?s honor that Chelsea and her four friends decide to return. The house awaits them, meticulously rebuilt. Only, Chelsea is haunted by ghostly visions. Loner Ryan stirs up old hurts and forces golden boy Chase to play peacemaker. Which has perfect hostess Kennedy on edge as eerie events culminate in a stunning accusation: Emily?s death wasn?t an accident. And all the clues needed to find the person responsible are right here. As old betrayals rise to the surface, Chelsea and her friends have one night to unravel a mystery spanning three summers before a killer among them exacts their revenge.</p>

<p>Summary : ?Non smetter? mai di piovere. Continuer? per sempre. Non sar? pi? possibile uscire all?aperto, l?acqua salir?, raggiunger? i piani alti dei palazzi, tutti moriranno e l?umanit? si estinguer? insieme agli animali in terra. Sopravvivranno solo i pesci. Non smetter? mai di piovere, e non importa. Sar? meglio, anzi, cos? questa maledetta citt? si laver?, alla fine?. Leonida Brancato era stato un penalista imbattibile. Il re del cavillo, lo chiamavano. Quando era andato in pensione, in procura avevano fatto festa. Da anni non si sapeva pi? nulla di lui, ma ora qualcuno lo ha ucciso e ha infierito sul suo cadavere. Un omicidio che appare privo di movente e che mette di nuovo alla prova i Bastardi. Sotto un diluvio che non concede tregua, circondati da nemici e nonostante dolorosi problemi personali, i formidabili poliziotti del commissariato di Pizzofalcone si districheranno fra segreti, ipocrisie, rancori. Arrivando a scoprire una verit? quanto mai inaspettata.</p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;Both passionate and humorous, this?lively memoir journeys from Jim Sharman?s colorful childhood in his father&#8217;s boxing troupe to his travels through Berlin, London, Sydney, and?Tokyo, via the international successes of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Hair, and Jesus Christ Superstar. This dynamic chronicle reveals behind-the-scenes details from the performances, recounts conversations with Lou Reed, and describes a fateful meeting with author Patrick White. From the rough and ready world of outback Australia in the 1950s?where boxers and &#8220;pantomime dames&#8221; shared the stage?to the cultural explosion of the 1970s and beyond, this is more than just a remarkable story about Australia; it is a moving tribute to a?legendary family in the entertainment world.</p>

<p>Summary : Classic movie buff Bailey ?Mink? Rydell has spent months crushing on a witty film geek she only knows online by ?Alex.? Two coasts separate the teens until Bailey moves in with her dad, who lives in the same California surfing town as her online crush.Faced with doubts (what if he?s a creep in real life?or worse?), Bailey doesn?t tell Alex she?s moved to his hometown. Or that she?s landed a job at the local tourist-trap museum. Or that she?s being heckled daily by the irritatingly hot museum security guard, Porter Roth?a.k.a. her new arch-nemesis. But life is whole lot messier than the movies, especially when Bailey discovers that tricky fine line between hate, love, and whatever-it-is she?s starting to feel for Porter.And as the summer months go by, Bailey must choose whether to cling to a dreamy online fantasy in Alex or take a risk on an imperfect reality with Porter. The choice is both simpler and more complicated than she realizes, because Porter Roth is hiding a secret of his </p>

Or that she?s landed a job at the local tourist-trap museum. Or that she?s being heckled daily by the irritatingly hot museum security guard, Porter Roth?a.k.a. her new arch-nemesis. But life is whole lot messier than the movies, especially when Bailey discovers that tricky fine line between hate, love, and whatever-it-is she?s starting to feel for Porter.And as the summer months go by, Bailey must choose whether to cling to a dreamy online fantasy in Alex or take a risk on an imperfect reality with Porter.

<p>Summary : Growing up in Emerald Lakes, population six hundred and eighty-two, had been safe and comfortable. Running my own magic shop and making a living off my green witchcraft, I have no complaints. Sure, there?s my ex, who never understood the word ?no?, but there?s also the lovable and eccentric townspeople who feel more like one huge extended family, and let?s not forget my boy-crazed Gran who keeps us all on our toes&#8230;.But something has apparently been missing, and the stars take it upon themselves to correct the problem, dropping four sexy men at my door. Well, not literally. They move into the apartment above my shop, so I?m their landlord. Drawn in by these mages who blew into town on a work assignment, a whole different kind of magic starts to grow between us, but my powers are doing things they shouldn?t, and there?s also a pesky prophecy to unravel.Strange, unnatural things are brewing in Emerald Lakes, and I can?t ignore the sinking suspicion that something life-changing is </p>

<p>Summary : The first major book on Vikings by a Scandinavian author to be published in English reframes the struggle for a North Sea empire and puts listeners in the mindset of Vikings, providing new insight into their goals, values, and what they chose to live and die for. The Wolf Age takes listeners on a thrilling journey through the bloody shared history of England and Scandinavia, and on across early medieval Europe, from the wild Norwegian fjords to the wealthy cities of Muslim Andalusia. Warfare, plotting, backstabbing, and bribery abound as Tore Skeie skillfully weaves sagas and skaldic poetry with breathless dramatization as he entertainingly brings the world of the Vikings and Anglo-Saxons to vivid life. In the eleventh century, the rulers of the lands surrounding the North Sea are all hungry for power. To get power they need soldiers, to get soldiers they need silver, and to get silver there is no better way than war and plunder. This vicious cycle draws all the lands of the north </p>

<p>Summary : Listening Length 	14 hours and 32 minutesLarkin is tired of her friends constantly trying to play Cupid. Just because they are all happily mated doesn&#8217;t mean she needs to be. And she definitely doesn&#8217;t need the over-protective men in her life vetting potential partners for her. In a bid to get them off her back, the harpy turns to the one person she knows they would never approve of . . .Teague Sullivan. Explicitly sexy and unquestionably alpha male, the mysterious hellhound is the perfect candidate for a fake relationship. More than happy to spend time with the pretty harpy, Teague agrees. But when a wager is made between them, and things start to heat up, Larkin can&#8217;t seem to ignore their explosive chemistry- and neither can her demon.But when old and new dangers creep up on them, and Teague&#8217;s shady past starts to ring alarm bells; he must decide whether to trust Larkin completely or risk losing her forever.</p>

<p>Summary : Listening Length 	14 hours and 32 minutesLarkin is tired of her friends constantly trying to play Cupid. Just because they are all happily mated doesn&#8217;t mean she needs to be. And she definitely doesn&#8217;t need the over-protective men in her life vetting potential partners for her. In a bid to get them off her back, the harpy turns to the one person she knows they would never approve of . . .Teague Sullivan. Explicitly sexy and unquestionably alpha male, the mysterious hellhound is the perfect candidate for a fake relationship. More than happy to spend time with the pretty harpy, Teague agrees. But when a wager is made between them, and things start to heat up, Larkin can&#8217;t seem to ignore their explosive chemistry- and neither can her demon.But when old and new dangers creep up on them, and Teague&#8217;s shady past starts to ring alarm bells; he must decide whether to trust Larkin completely or risk losing her forever.</p>

<p>Summary : You can choose hope in the midst of chaos. The visionary behind the million-strong IF:Gathering challenges you to exercise your God-given power to shift negative thinking patterns and take back control of your thoughts and emotions.Are your thoughts holding you captive? I?ll never be good enough. Other people have better lives than I do. God couldn?t really love me. Jennie Allen knows what it?s like to swirl in a spiral of destructive thoughts, but she also knows we don?t have to stay stuck in toxic thinking patterns. As she discovered in her own life, God built a way for us to escape that downward spiral. Freedom comes when we refuse to be victims to our thoughts and realize we have already been equipped with power from God to fight and win the war for our minds. In Get Out of Your Head, Jennie inspires and equips us to transform our emotions, our outlook, and even our circumstances by taking control of our thoughts. Our enemy is determined to get in our heads to make us feel </p>

Out of the dark tunnel of boring literary analysis assignments, they lead you into a world where students learn to write fresh, compelling, authentic arguments based on their own unique interests. ?There is a place for analysis of literature in our classrooms,? they write. ?But we think there is more.

To open your mind to the real world of analytical writing, and challenge traditional notions about what students should be analyzing and how they should write it.?Allison and Rebekah offer a broadened definition of analysis for the 21st century classroom. ?Analysis is everywhere,? they argue. ?It?s about video games and athletes? seasons, and the latest album, or the new Netflix series.?

To open your mind to the real world of analytical writing, and challenge traditional notions about what students should be analyzing and how they should write it.?Allison and Rebekah offer a broadened definition of analysis for the 21st century classroom. ?Analysis is everywhere,? they argue. ?It?s about video games and athletes? seasons, and the latest album, or the new Netflix series.?

<p>Summary : When I look in the mirror now I don?t see the terrified child who was systematically abused, both mentally and physically. If you passed me in the street, you wouldn?t notice either. You might see the small scar on my neck that was inflicted by a knife being pressed to my throat. You might notice a lump on my left wrist where the bones didn?t heal properly after it was fractured. You might notice small scars on my arms where I was used as a live ashtray. But you won?t see the scars that are deep inside me ? the ones which take a lifetime to heal. They?re ingrained in me, trapped under the surface like fish under a frozen lake, waiting for the moment when the surface cracks and they can come to life again. These mental scars are the demons that haunted me when I was at my lowest point. They came out to torment me, rearing their ugly head in the darkness. Then they would retreat again for a time, making me think I?d got over what happened to me, only to show up when I least expected </p>

<p>Summary : When I look in the mirror now I don?t see the terrified child who was systematically abused, both mentally and physically. If you passed me in the street, you wouldn?t notice either. You might see the small scar on my neck that was inflicted by a knife being pressed to my throat. You might notice a lump on my left wrist where the bones didn?t heal properly after it was fractured. You might notice small scars on my arms where I was used as a live ashtray. But you won?t see the scars that are deep inside me ? the ones which take a lifetime to heal. They?re ingrained in me, trapped under the surface like fish under a frozen lake, waiting for the moment when the surface cracks and they can come to life again. These mental scars are the demons that haunted me when I was at my lowest point. They came out to torment me, rearing their ugly head in the darkness. Then they would retreat again for a time, making me think I?d got over what happened to me, only to show up when I least expected </p>

<p>Summary : With 35 years experience, Laurie Pettitt knows more than most about the &#8216;mucky green art&#8217; of rebuilding VW air-cooled engines. Written with genuine enthusiasm and a little humor, this step-by-step guide is like having a knowledgeable friend or older brother sat right next to you at the workbench. Learn how to remove and strip down your engine before taking a really good look at what&#8217;s inside. Work out what&#8217;s good and what&#8217;s not. You will learn to examine components and find that often they are not only serviceable but better than modern reproduction parts. Reusing the original parts wherever possible, you will then learn how to prepare and reassemble your engine with plenty of tips and tricks to make the job easier. The importance of cooling tinware is emphasised and its refitting covered model by model.

<p>Summary : Pia has grown up in a secret laboratory hidden deep in the Amazon rain forest. She was raised by a team of scientists who have created her to be the start of a new immortal race. But on the night of her seventeenth birthday, Pia discovers a hole in the electric fence that surrounds her sterile home?and sneaks outside the compound for the first time in her life.Free in the jungle, Pia meets Eio, a boy from a nearby village. Together, they embark on a race against time to discover the truth about Pia?s origin?a truth with deadly consequences that will change their lives forever.Origin is a beautifully told, shocking new way to look at an age-old desire: to live forever, no matter the cost. This is a supremely compelling debut novel that blends the awakening romance of Matched with the mystery and jungle conspiracy of Lost.</p>

<p>Summary : Non esiste luce senza ombra. Non esiste amore senza dolore. Per Thomas e Vanessa amarsi non ? mai stato facile. La loro storia ? sempre in bilico fra estasi e dannazione, sospesa in un equilibrio instabile. Non bastano un cielo stellato da contemplare o una casetta sull?albero in cui rifugiarsi, il sentimento che li lega vive di notti infuocate e gelosia feroce, scintille di romanticismo e incomprensioni che paiono insormontabili. Dopo aver rischiato di perdersi, per?, le cose sembrano aver preso finalmente a girare per il verso giusto. Per la prima volta Thomas accetta di mostrarsi vulnerabile e svela a Vanessa quali fantasmi lo perseguitano. Nel suo passato, infatti, c?? uno strappo, una tragedia che lo ha reso il grumo di rabbia e dolore che ? oggi, un?anima spezzata incapace di legarsi. Eppure nemmeno questa ritrovata vicinanza sembra essere sufficiente, perch? la sofferenza che lo attanaglia ? troppo profonda. Mentre Thomas ? prigioniero di una spirale autodistruttiva, Vanessa e </p>

<p>Summary : In this international bestselling romance by Megan Maxwell, love is the ultimate forbidden pleasure.Getting stuck in an elevator with a flirtatious and charismatic stranger leaves Jude Flores flustered enough?even before she realizes that he?s Eric Zimmerman, the powerful billionaire CEO?and her powerfully sexy new boss.Having arrived in Spain to take over his company?s office, Eric is clearly interested in more than business. He notices Jude for her brilliance and talent, but it?s her humility that excites him the most.Seduced by Eric?s attention, Jude accepts his bold invitation into his private life?a series of secret sensual games designed to open Jude up to a world of pleasure she?d only fantasized about.

<p>Summary : Published to international critical and popular acclaim, this intensely romantic yet stunningly realistic novel spans three generations and the unimaginable gulf between the First World War and the present. As the young Englishman Stephen Wraysford passes through a tempestuous love affair with Isabelle Azaire in France and enters the dark, surreal world beneath the trenches of No Man&#8217;s Land, Sebastian Faulks creates a world of fiction that is as tragic as A Farewell to Arms and as sensuous as The English Patient. Crafted from the ruins of war and the indestructibility of love, Birdsong is a novel that will be read and marveled at for years to come.</p>

<p>Summary : Published to international critical and popular acclaim, this intensely romantic yet stunningly realistic novel spans three generations and the unimaginable gulf between the First World War and the present. As the young Englishman Stephen Wraysford passes through a tempestuous love affair with Isabelle Azaire in France and enters the dark, surreal world beneath the trenches of No Man&#8217;s Land, Sebastian Faulks creates a world of fiction that is as tragic as A Farewell to Arms and as sensuous as The English Patient. Crafted from the ruins of war and the indestructibility of love, Birdsong is a novel that will be read and marveled at for years to come.</p>

<p>Summary : Jerusalem is the epic history of three thousand years of faith, fanaticism, bloodshed, and coexistence, from King David to the 21st century, from the birth of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam to the Israel-Palestine conflict. ? How did this small, remote town become the Holy City, the ?center of the world? and now the key to peace in the Middle East? In a gripping narrative, Simon Sebag Montefiore reveals this ever-changing city in its many incarnations, bringing every epoch and character blazingly to life. Jerusalem?s biography is told through the wars, love affairs, and revelations of the men and women who created, destroyed, chronicled and believed in Jerusalem. As well as the many ordinary Jerusalemites who have left their mark on the city, its cast varies from Solomon, Saladin and Suleiman the Magnificent to Cleopatra, Caligula and Churchill; from Abraham to Jesus and Muhammad; from the ancient world of Jezebel, Nebuchadnezzar, Herod and Nero to the modern times of the Kaiser, </p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;Sam, could you do me a favor?&#8221; A seemingly simple request sparks the story that has now become part of America&#8217;s true crime hall of fame. It is a gory, grotesque tale befitting a Stephen King novel. It is also a David and Goliath saga-the story of a young lawyer fresh from the Public Defender&#8217;s Office whose first client in private practice turns out to be the most evil serial killer in our nation-s history. Sam Amirante had just opened his first law practice when he got a phone call from his friend John Wayne Gacy, a well-known and well-liked community figure. Gacy was upset about what he called &#8220;police harassment&#8221; and asked Amirante for help. With the police following his every move in connection with the disappearance of a local teenager, Gacy eventually gives a drunken early morning confession to his friend and new lawyer. Gacy is soon charged with murder and Amirante suddenly becomes the defense attorney for one of American&#8217;s most disturbing serial killers. It is his first case. </p>

<p>Summary : Introduction to Ecological Psychology is a highly accessible book that offers an overview of the fundamental theoretical foundations of Ecological Psychology. The authors, Julia Blau and Jeffrey Wagman, provide a broad coverage of the topic, including discussion of perception-action as well as development, cognition, social interaction, and application to real world problems.Concepts are presented in the book using a conversational writing style and everyday examples that introduce novice readers to the problems of perception and action and demonstrate the application of the Ecological approach theories to broader philosophical questions.

<p>Summary : Landmark world history from the creator of the Top Ten podcast Fall of Civilizations.Based on the podcast with over 100 million downloads, Fall of Civilizations brilliantly explores how a range of ancient societies rose to power and sophistication, and how they tipped over into collapse.Across the centuries, we journey from the great empires of Mesopotamia to those of Khmer and Vijayanagara in Asia and Songhai in West Africa; from Byzantium to the Maya, Inca and Aztecs of Central America; from Roman Britain to Rapa Nui. With meticulous research, breathtaking insight and dazzling, empathic storytelling, historian and novelist Paul Cooper evokes the majesty and jeopardy of these ancient civilizations, and asks what it might have felt like for a person alive at the time to witness the end of their world.</p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  ?It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man of over forty is in possession of a major defect . . .? <br />
Cassandra Leigh has woken as if from a bad dream: forty-four, childless and twenty-plus years into an affair with a married man. Max assures her they just need a little more patience and for his wife to die (!) but Cass is desperate for a baby and running out of time. Maybe Max is not the only man for her?There?s her friend Jason ? though he?s perhaps a little too rugged, and there?s something strange about the way his wife disappeared . . . Or there?s Dante, the mysterious stranger she meets on a dark night in his haunted manor house . . . Cass must throw caution to the wind and claim the life she?s always wanted. Suddenly, it?s a choice between Mr Right, Mr Wrong or Mr Right Now . . . <br />
  Fantastically funny and whimsical, this heart-warming novel will charm fans of Milly Johnson and Jill Mansell.</p>

<p>Summary : A DOROTHY KOOMSON BOOK OF THE YEAR AN ECONOMIST BOOK OF THE YEAR &#8216;Such a beautiful read, like chatting to a friend over a cuppa. This is the intimate, insightful read that I didn&#8217;t know I needed. Just brilliant.&#8217; Dorothy Koomson Nana Darkoa Sekyiamah spent decades talking openly and intimately to African women around the world about sex. In this book, she brings together their extraordinary stories, whilst also chronicling her own journey towards sexual freedom. From finding queer community in Egypt to living a polyamorous life in Senegal to understanding the intersectionality of religion and pleasure in Cameroon, their necessary narratives are individual and illuminating. This stunning collection provides crucial insight into our quest for sexual power and offers all women inspirational examples to live a truly liberated life. &#8216;Touching, joyful, defiant &#8211; and honest.&#8217; Economist, Books of the Year 2021 &#8216;Fascinating.&#8217; Bernadine Evaristo &#8216;Honest and moving. A vital treasure.&#8217; Bolu </p>

Dimitar Bechev traces the political trajectory of Erdo?an?s populist regime, from the era of reform and prosperity in the 2000s to the effects of the war in neighboring Syria. In a tale of missed opportunities, Bechev explores how Turkey parted ways with the United States and Europe, embraced Putin?s Russia and other revisionist powers, and replaced a frail democratic regime with an authoritarian one. Despite this, he argues that Turkey?s democratic instincts are resilient, its economic ties to Europe are as strong as </p>

Okay, she&#8217;s totally complaining.After being laid off from her secretarial position, she has no choice but to join the family business, and now she?s a full-time grim reaper. That?s right. She collects and transfers souls to the hereafter.Cool, huh? Not quite.On the second day of her new job, Aisling (literally!) stumbles over a dead body that?s not on her list and the stakes are suddenly raised because, when a name isn?t on the list, that means someone stole it (and that&#8217;s never a good thing). Aisling?s family, which consists of a tempestuous father and four overbearing older brothers, are hot on the case ? but the answers they?re coming up with aren?t exactly soothing. It seems a contingent of wraiths have descended on the area, and they?re not just dangerous for unsuspecting souls and the general populace. The Grimlock family is at risk, too. If </p>

<p>Summary : Technology permeates nearly every aspect of our daily lives. Cars enable us to travel long distances, mobile phones help us to communicate, and medical devices make it possible to detect and cure diseases. But these aids to existence are not simply neutral instruments: they give shape to what we do and how we experience the world. And because technology plays such an active role in shaping our daily actions and decisions, it is crucial, Peter-Paul Verbeek argues, that we consider the moral dimension of technology. Moralizing Technology offers exactly that: an in-depth study of the ethical dilemmas and moral issues surrounding the interaction of humans and technology. Drawing from Heidegger and Foucault, as well as from philosophers of technology such as Don Ihde and Bruno Latour, Peter-Paul Verbeek locates morality not just in the human users of technology but in the interaction between us and our machines.

Of course, all kinds of outrageous tales surround my palace. People say I?m a sorcerer constantly in heat, the orgies in my bathhouses never end, and every so often, a young alpha expires in my arms from exhaustion.The truth is much simpler; I love pleasure, and relish in erotic beauty, so I surround myself with it. My omega companions and my loyal guards love me, and our arrangement is far happier than most marriages can aspire to be.Except now, I must find the right alpha to father my heir, and I need to choose carefully.?JonahKing Sebastian is the single most stunning creature in the whole of the universe. He looks like a god of pleasure and fertility, so of course all his ministers and soldiers follow him with the blindness of men in love.I?m a dirty commoner, a mere horse handler.

<p>Summary : Everyone eats, but rarely do we ask why or investigate why we eat what we eat. Why do we love spices, sweets, coffee? How did rice become such a staple food throughout so much of eastern Asia? Everyone Eats examines the social and cultural reasons for our food choices and provides an explanation of the nutritional reasons for why humans eat, resulting in a unique cultural and biological approach to the topic. E. N. Anderson explains the economics of food in the globalization era, food&#8217;s relationship to religion, medicine, and ethnicity as well as offers suggestions on how to end hunger, starvation, and malnutrition.Everyone Eats feeds our need to understand human ecology by explaining the ways that cultures and political systems structure the edible environment.</p>

  The last thing he needs is a distraction. <br />
Hunter Hutchin?s success is due to one thing, and one thing only: his unerring focus on Beaten Path, the outdoor recreation company he built from the ground up after his first business was an utter failure.When his dad gets sick, Hunter is forced to go back to his hometown and prove once and for all that his father?s belief in him wasn?t for nothing. With illness looming, distractions are unacceptable.Staying with his sister, he meets Hannah, the sexy nanny who has had his head in a frenzy since they met.When Hunter?s dad gets sick, he?s forced to leave the city and move back into the small town he grew up in at his sister?s house. Ever since he watched Hannah dance into his life, he?s finding himself drifting from his goals and purpose &#8211; or is he drifting closer to them? <br />
  She refuses to make the same mistakes as her mother. <br />
Hannah Keller grew up watching what happens when a family falls apart and lived through those consequences. When </p>

The higher the rank he has tattooed onto his neck, the better his life will be.To his surprise and horror, Al is revealed to be rank zero, the lowest of the low. He&#8217;s now not only an outcast ? he&#8217;s also a danger to his entire family. So Al goes on the run, fleeing the brutal Cullers, men who hunt down zeroes . . . and put them to death.Cast out of his home, cut off from his friends, and armed with only a sword and his wits, Al is reduced to just surviving. As he meets other outcasts, however, he begins to suspect that he is a pawn in a larger game ? and that he might have the power to tip the scales in a high-stakes struggle between man and dragon.</p>

Violence is all he knows. Death and brutality are the masters of his fate.After years of incarceration in an underground hell, only one thought occupies his mind: revenge&#8230;bloody, slow and violent revenge.Revenge on the man who lied.Revenge on the man who wronged him.Revenge on the man who condemned him and turned him into this: a rage-fueled killing machine.

<p>Summary : How does one survive when all hope is lost?In the middle of the night in 1997, Doctors Without Borders administrator Christophe Andr? was kidnapped by armed men and taken away to an unknown destination in the Caucasus region. For three months, Andr? was kept handcuffed in solitary confinement, with little to survive on and almost no contact with the outside world. Close to twenty years later, award-winning cartoonist Guy Delisle (Pyongyang, Jerusalem, Shenzhen, Burma Chronicles) recounts Andr?s harrowing experience in Hostage, a book that attests to the power of one man?s determination in the face of a hopeless situation.Marking a departure from the author?s celebrated first-person travelogues, Delisle tells the story through the perspective of the titular captive, who strives to keep his mind alert as desperation starts to set in. Working in a pared down style with muted color washes, Delisle conveys the psychological effects of solitary confinement, compelling us to ask ourselves </p>

Readers will once again be inspired by how the kids face their challenges and by the adults who help them along the way.Jeffrey, Alexia, Anna, Danielle, Luke, Peter, and Jessica are thrilled to have their beloved teacher, Mr. Terupt, back for the school year as their biweekly advisor. They still rely on him for guidance in everything, including these predicaments:JEFFREY wants to make varsity wrestling, but at what cost?

<p>Summary : An exploration of humanity&#8217;s age-old fascination with Sirens. Explains the Sirens; half-human, half-animal bodies as a metaphor for the psychological challenge that their myth has always embodied; Fully illustrated in color with works by Rubens, Bosch, Munch, Magritte, and others. Their celestial voices drove mast-lashed Ulysses nearly out of his mind with libidinous promises as they beckoned him ever-closer to paradise&#8211;or a rocky death. With womanly torsos and animal lower halves, usually birds or fish, Sirens have long been symbols of the lure of desire&#8211;the feminine, as seducer&#8211;beckoning men to mystery beyond their ken, or to disaster. This book is both a celebration of Sirens and an examination of the psychology of dichotomy&#8211;the diametrically opposed drives and inherent conflicts underlying this female archetype.Since antiquity, Sirens and their mermaid sisters have maintained an ongoing affair of the heart with humanity&#8217;s greatest writers and artists. Sirens play important </p>

<p>Summary : Beautiful Morgan Fitzgerald had every reason to hate the Yankees. They murdered her father, killed her ma &#8211; they destroyed everything she cherished and loved. And she swore she&#8217;d kill every last one of them, until she met Lieutenant Marc Riordan. She tried to hate him, but when he held her in his arms the whole world vanished and time ceased to exist. Her body ached for only one man, her heart longed for her Yankee love.Lieutenant Marc Riordan hated war, with its senseless killing and destruction. But when he saw the gorgeous, green-eyed beauty with her long auburn hair, he totally forgot about fighting all he could think of was love. He wanted to pleasure Morgan&#8217;s silken body with his kisses; he wanted to take her to the heights of rapture. Marc never dreamed he&#8217;d fall in love with the enemy and have to fight an endless battle to win her heart.</p>
