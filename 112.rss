<p>Summary : All qualitative researchers sample, yet methods of sampling and choosing cases have received relatively little attention compared to other qualitative methods. This innovative book critically evaluates widely used sampling strategies, identifying key theoretical assumptions and considering how empirical and theoretical claims are made from these diverse methods. Nick Emmel presents a groundbreaking reworking of sampling and choosing cases in qualitative research. Drawing on international case studies from across the social sciences he shows how ideas drive choices, how cases are used to work out the relation between ideas and evidence, and why it is not the size of a sample that matters, it is how cases are used to interpret and explain that counts. Fresh, dynamic and timely, this book is essential reading for researchers and postgraduate students engaging with sampling and realism in qualitative research.</p>

<p>Summary : A famous English chef who&#8217;s tired of being hunted by the tabloid press. An American model who&#8217;s tired of being used for his looks. An anonymous first encounter in an adults-only club. And the age gap between them is the least of their problems. Can Sebastian Fox and Ezra Whitfield find happiness together despite their differences? *** Star Spanked is a standalone low-angst romance novel seasoned with a teaspoon of boss/employee tension, half a cup of discipline, and topped with a delicious 17-year age gap. HFN/HEA guaranteed, and no cliffhangers. While this book is part of a series, it can be read on its own, but characters from previous books do show up in cameos. Content Note: this book contains occasional allusions to restricted eating and diets, fashion industry standards for models, and body dysmorphia</p>

<p>Summary : Data is powerful. It separates leaders from laggards and it drives business disruption, transformation, and reinvention. Today&#8217;s most progressive companies are using the power of data to propel their industries into new areas of innovation, specialization, and optimization. The horsepower of new tools and technologies have provided more opportunities than ever to harness, integrate, and interact with massive amounts of disparate data for business insights and value &#8211; something that will only continue in the era of the Internet of Things. And, as a new breed of tech-savvy and digitally native knowledge workers rise to the ranks of data scientist and visual analyst, the needs and demands of the people working with data are changing, too.The world of data is changing fast. And, it&#8217;s becoming more visual.Visual insights are becoming increasingly dominant in information management, and with the reinvigorated role of data visualization, this imperative is a driving force to creating a </p>

<p>Summary : In 2013, when the state of Oklahoma erected a statue of the Ten Commandments on the grounds of the state capitol, a group calling themselves The Satanic Temple applied to erect a statue of Baphomet alongside the Judeo-Christian tablets. Since that time, The Satanic Temple has become a regular voice in national conversations about religious freedom, disestablishment, and government overreach. In addition to petitioning for Baphomet to appear alongside another monument of the Ten Commandments in Arkansas, the group has launched campaigns to include Satanic &#8220;nativity scenes&#8221; on government property in Florida, Michigan, and Indiana, offer Satanic prayers at a high school football game in Seattle, and create &#8220;After School Satan&#8221; programs in elementary schools that host Christian extracurricular programs. Since their 2012 founding, The Satanic Temple has established 19 chapters and now claims 100,000 supporters. Is this just a political group perpetuating a series of stunts? Or is it a </p>

<p>Summary : Newly broke girl Alexandria Asher just wants to live a normal life. After her parents are sent to prison on embezzlement charges, she enrolls in college under her mother?s maiden name and tries her best to pretend she?s someone else.Tristan Prescott is everything Alex is trying to avoid. A seemingly egotistical, lazy, rich jerk, she dumps her beer on his head when he comes on to her one night at a party. This only spurs Tristan into action. He loves nothing more than a challenge. And the beautiful Alex is exactly the type of challenge that intrigues him.Despite her reluctance, Alex finds herself quickly involved with Tristan. Underneath that playboy exterior is a good guy, a sweet and sexy guy who she is undoubtedly falling for. What they both don?t realize is the actions of Alex?s parents are the reason for so much tragedy in Tristan?s family. And when Tristan discovers who Alex and her family really is, can he forgive and forget?</p>

<p>Summary : Three women. One bloody mystery, and a prophesy that transcends time. People have gone missing and no one knows where they&#8217;ve gone. The only clue left behind is blood, lots of blood, and a single silver brooch.Magda Stoner, captain of the airship Verity, has questions, and the Order for which she works has no answers to give. She has been directed to enlist assistance from Lucinda Ravensburgh, a tower witch and truthsayer.Lucinda sees truth in everything she touches, a gift, or curse, enhanced by the magic of the tower in which she resides. It&#8217;s a gift that comes with great responsibility and a duty to those she serves. When Magda asks for aid, Lucinda cannot refuse.Whilst Magda and Lucinda seek the evil behind the disappearances, all manner of threats imperil their lives. Ascara is the warrior who must protect them as their search becomes more and more dangerous.At the moment Lucinda touches the silver brooch, all three lives are changed forever. Three must become one if these </p>

<p>Summary : Stetson Barron has been the center of my world since I was twelve. But with our ten-year age difference and my quirky nature, I didn?t think I was more to him than his little sister?s what color is her hair this month best friend. Until one hot summer night when I climbed him like a water tower at his cousin?s wedding.And then he didn?t talk to me for weeks after.A pink plus sign and an OMG what am I going to do? later, the trailer I lived in with my mom burned down. Stetson showed up at the ER like a country knight on a diesel-powered steed, arranged a place for my mom to stay, and took me home with him.The weeks of radio silence after our hookup left me wary. I?d been into Stetson for too long not to lose myself in him given half the chance, and now that his attention?s fully on me, I?m sinking. My mom was in the same place as me once, and I refuse to be an obligation to a guy, even if he?s the man of my dreams.</p>

<p>Summary : How much would you risk to save the ones you love? Would you tempt even the most dangerous fate?Briseis has one chance to save her mother, but she&#8217;ll need to do the impossible: find the last fragment of the deadly Absyrtus Heart. If she is to locate the missing piece, she must turn to the blood relatives she&#8217;s never known, learn about their secret powers, and take her place in their ancient lineage. Briseis is not the only one who wants the Heart, and her enemies will stop at nothing to fulfill their own ruthless plans. The fates tell of a truly dangerous journey, one that could end in more heartache, more death. Bolstered by the sisterhood of ancient magic, can Briseis harness her power to save the people she loves most?</p>

<p>Summary : How much would you risk to save the ones you love? Would you tempt even the most dangerous fate?Briseis has one chance to save her mother, but she&#8217;ll need to do the impossible: find the last fragment of the deadly Absyrtus Heart. If she is to locate the missing piece, she must turn to the blood relatives she&#8217;s never known, learn about their secret powers, and take her place in their ancient lineage. Briseis is not the only one who wants the Heart, and her enemies will stop at nothing to fulfill their own ruthless plans. The fates tell of a truly dangerous journey, one that could end in more heartache, more death. Bolstered by the sisterhood of ancient magic, can Briseis harness her power to save the people she loves most?</p>

<p>Summary : Writer, critic and publisher of Adelphi Edizioni, Roberto Calasso condenses a lifetime&#8217;s knowledge into this short, illuminating mediatation on beauty, literature and design. From wether you can judge a book without its cover to a future of universal digitization, and from the most beautiful book ever printed to the elusive notion of quality, Calasso creates a vision of publishing as &#8216;a literary work in itself, belonging to a genre all its own&#8217;.&#8221;All books published by a certain publisher could be seen as links in a single chain, or segments in a serpentine progression of books, or fragments in a single book&#8221;</p>

<p>Summary : The latest in the Maple Hills series follows two summer camp counselors who reconnect after a sizzling one-night stand. Maple Hills students Russ Callaghan and Aurora Roberts cross paths at a party celebrating the end of the academic year, where a drinking game results in them having a passionate one-night stand. Never one to overstay her welcome (or expect much from a man), Aurora slips away before Russ even has the chance to ask for her full name.  Imagine their surprise when they bump into each other on the first day of the summer camp where they are both counselors, hoping to escape their complicated home lives by spending the summer working. Russ hopes if he gets far enough away from Maple Hills, he can avoid dealing with the repercussions of his father?s gambling addiction, while Aurora is tired of craving attention from everyone around her, and wants to go back to the last place she truly felt at home.  Russ knows breaking the camp?s strict ?no staff fraternizing? rule will </p>

<p>Summary : With The Human Animal Earthling Identity Carrie P. Freeman asks us to reconsider the devastating division we have created between the human and animal conditions, leading to mass exploitation, injustice, and extinction.

<p>Summary : Critically acclaimed and bestselling authors Becky Albertalli and Adam Silvera combine their talents in this smart, funny, heartfelt collaboration about two very different boys who can?t decide if the universe is pushing them together?or pulling them apart.ARTHUR is only in New York for the summer, but if Broadway has taught him anything, it?s that the universe can deliver a showstopping romance when you least expect it.BEN thinks the universe needs to mind its business. If the universe had his back, he wouldn?t be on his way to the post office carrying a box of his ex-boyfriend?s things.But when Arthur and Ben meet-cute at the post office, what exactly does the universe have in store for them . . . ?Maybe nothing. After all, they get separated.Maybe everything. After all, they get reunited.But what if they can?t nail a first date even after three do-overs?What if Arthur tries too hard to make it work and Ben doesn?t try hard enough?What if life really isn?t like a Broadway play?But </p>

<p>Summary : Virginia Heath?s Never Rescue a Rogue , the next book in the Merriwell Sisters series, is filled with whip-smart banter, swoony romance, hilarious mishaps, and twisty reveals that will make you gasp and laugh in delight.Diana Merriwell and Giles Sinclair only tolerate one another for the sake of their nearest and dearest. Everyone believes that the two of them are meant to be together, but Diana and Giles know that their constant pithy barbs come from a shared disdain?not a hidden attraction. Diana loves the freedom of working at the newspaper too much to give it up for marriage, and Giles is happily married to his bachelor lifestyle. But they do have one thing in common?the secrets they can?t risk escaping.When Giles? father, the curmudgeonly Duke of Harpenden unexpectedly turns up his toes, it?s only a matter of time before someone comes crawling out of the woodwork who knows the true circumstances of his only son&#8217;s birth. As the threat of blackmail becomes real, Giles must uncover </p>

<p>Summary : Dialogue is often overlooked as a necessary and potent instrument in the novelist?s repertoire. A novel can rise or fall on the strength of its dialogue. Superb dialogue can make a superb novel. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote, ?Action is character.? George V. Higgins said, ?Dialogue is character.? They were both right, because dialogue is action. It comprises much, if not all, of the clarifying drama of any novel. How much physical action can there be in 300 pages, even in a crime novel or a thriller? And all conflict, even physical, begins as dialogue.Hough explains how dialogue can reveal a character?s nature as well as his or her defining impulses and emotions. He says there must be tension in every colloquy in fiction, and shows the reader ways to achieve it. Hough illustrates his precepts with examples from his own work and from that of the best modern writers of dialogue, including Cormac McCarthy, Kent Haruf, Joan Didion, Annie Proulx, Lee Smith, Elmore Leonard, George V. Higgins, </p>

<p>Summary : Ecology; Concepts and Applications was written this book for students taking their first undergraduate course in ecology. Ecology is an integrative discipline, and thus a foundation in other sciences in important. We have assumed that students in this course have some knowledge of basic chemistry and mathematics and that they have had a course in general biology that included introductions to physiology, biological diversity, and evolution.When writing this text the authors had four goals in mind:  Teach the foundations of ecology using Canadian examples to help students relate to the material.   Link the science of ecology to real-world problems.   Emphasize the linkage between ecology and evolutionary biology.   Enhance quantitative understanding of students.  </p>

Il buio si infranse intorno a noi come vetro.L&#8217;orfana Alina Starkov non ha grandi ambizioni nella vita, le basterebbe fare al meglio il suo lavoro di apprendista cartografa nell&#8217;esercito di Ravka, un tempo nazione potente e ora regno circondato dai nemici, e poter stare accanto al suo buon amico Mal, il ragazzo con cui ? cresciuta e di cui ? innamorata da molto tempo. Ma il destino ha in serbo ben altro per lei.Quando il loro reggimento attraversa la Faglia d&#8217;Ombra, la striscia di oscurit? quasi impenetrabile che taglia letteralmente in due il regno di Ravka, lei e i suoi compagni vengono attaccati dagli esseri spaventosi e affamati che l? dimorano. E proprio nel momento in cui Alina si lancia in soccorso dell&#8217;amico Mal ferito gravemente, in lei si risveglia un potere enorme, come una luce improvvisa e intensa </p>

<p>Summary : Wanted: One roommate to share a 3-bedroom house, split the rent, and ideally not be the guy I can?t stop thinking about.I?m a man with too many secrets, so the last thing I need is a new roommate with a sexy smile and blue eyes that see right through me. Eight years ago, Roderick left town after high school. We?re not friends. I owe him nothing. But back then, I let one of my secrets slip, and he?s the only one who noticed. Part of me knows I should run far, far away. But the other part wants him to come upstairs and spend the night. But if I let him in, I could lose everything. Seeking: A room to rent in town. I?m tidy, have no pets, and I will feed you homemade bread.I should probably add: Gay AF, and has no filter. It?s no wonder my new landlord is so wary of me. A smarter man would ignore those hot glances from Kieran Shipley. The broody lumberjack wants more from me than another homemade pretzel, but if I push my luck, I?ll end up back on the street.Too bad I?ve never been smart </p>

Having spent her childhood in a forest, raising herself and her frightening creations?the only friends she?s ever known?she?s ill prepared for the scarred royal and his fearsome brutality. Not to mention the ferocity of their connection and the carnality of his touch. But the real problem? Her brother is Micah?s greatest foe.

<p>Summary : Forbidden. Powerful. Ruthless.?Micah the Unwilling, fae King of the Forgotten, can tame even the most violent of beasts. Forged on the battlefield, this iron-willed warrior considers his soldiers his family, and he will stop at nothing to reclaim their dispossessed land. Gearing for war with a sadistic enemy, he is disciplined and focused?until a feral beauty he encountered long ago wanders into his camp.?Viori de Aoibheall wields a terrifying ability to sing monsters to life. Having spent her childhood in a forest, raising herself and her frightening creations?the only friends she?s ever known?she?s ill prepared for the scarred royal and his fearsome brutality. Not to mention the ferocity of their connection and the carnality of his touch. But the real problem? Her brother is Micah?s greatest foe. And though the sensual king makes her burn, she must stop him, whatever the cost.</p>

<p>Summary : Why great powers decline, from Spain to the United StatesThe extent and irreversibility of US decline is becoming ever more obvious as America loses war after war and as one industry after another loses its technological edge.

Rather, decline is the product of elites&#8217; success in grabbing control over resources and governmental powers. Not only are ordinary people harmed, but also capitalists become increasingly unable to coordinate their interests and adopt policies and make investments necessary to counter economic and geopolitical competitors elsewhere in the world.Conflicts among elites and challenges by non-elites determine the timing and mold the </p>

<p>Summary : 2 March 1810&#8230; Today, I fell in love.At the age of ten, Miranda Cheever showed no signs of Great Beauty. And even at ten, Miranda learned to accept the expectations society held for her?until the afternoon when Nigel Bevelstoke, the handsome and dashing Viscount Turner, solemnly kissed her hand and promised her that one day she would grow into herself, that one day she would be as beautiful as she already was smart. And even at ten, Miranda knew she would love him forever.But the years that followed were as cruel to Turner as they were kind to Miranda. She is as intriguing as the viscount boldly predicted on that memorable day?while he is a lonely, bitter man, crushed by a devastating loss. But Miranda has never forgotten the truth she set down on paper all those years earlier?and she will not allow the love that is her destiny to slip lightly through her fingers&#8230;</p>

<p>Summary : She was close enough to see that the girl had written a word on the wall in bright, warm red blood. Not a word, actually. A name? Everyone in the small American town of Denton is searching for Isabelle Coleman, a missing seventeen-year-old girl. All they?ve found so far is her phone and another girl they didn?t even know was missing. Mute and completely unresponsive to the world around her, it?s clear this mysterious girl has been damaged beyond repair. All Detective Josie Quinn can get from her is a name: Ramona. Currently suspended from the force for misconduct, Josie takes matters into her own hands as the name leads her to evidence linking the two girls. She knows the race is on to find Isabelle alive, and she fears there may be others?  The trail leads Josie to another victim, a girl who escaped but whose case was labelled a hoax by authorities. To catch this monster, Josie must confront her own nightmares and follow her instinct to the darkest of places. But can she make it out </p>

<p>Summary : A fun, flirty teen debut from Wattpad phenom Alex Light about a fake relationship and real love. Perfect for Jenny Han fans.It?s been years since seventeen-year-old Becca Hart believed in true love. But when her former best friend teases her for not having had a boyfriend, Becca impulsively pretends she?s been secretly seeing someone.Brett Wells has it all. As captain of the football team and one of the most popular guys in his school, he should have no problem finding someone to date, but he?s always been more focused on his future than who to bring to prom.When he overhears Becca?s lie, Brett decides to step in and be the mystery guy. It?s the perfect solution: he gets people off his back for not having a meaningful relationship and she can keep up the ruse that she?s got a boyfriend.Acting like the perfect couple isn?t easy, though, especially when you barely know the other person. But with Becca still picking up the pieces from when her world was blown apart years ago and Brett </p>

<p>Summary : Alessio&#8230; Cold. Ruthless. Killer. I am respected and feared by all. I wasn&#8217;t put on this earth to love or be loved. I was put here to wipe out every last member of the damn Abandonato mafia, to pay them back for my mother&#8217;s death. When I find a strange girl hiding, beaten, under my bed, I don&#8217;t let her live out of compassion. She&#8217;s a trinket, my plaything. Ayla&#8230; I thought Alessio was only one more man who wanted to use me, hurt me, and throw me away. I don&#8217;t know what it is to trust anymore. I can&#8217;t find my heart under the pain. Alessio found it. He touched it, and brought it alive again. But if he discovers just how dangerous I am to him&#8230;I&#8217;ll lose my life.</p>

<p>Summary : Alessio&#8230; Cold. Ruthless. Killer. I am respected and feared by all. I wasn&#8217;t put on this earth to love or be loved. I was put here to wipe out every last member of the damn Abandonato mafia, to pay them back for my mother&#8217;s death. When I find a strange girl hiding, beaten, under my bed, I don&#8217;t let her live out of compassion. She&#8217;s a trinket, my plaything. Ayla&#8230; I thought Alessio was only one more man who wanted to use me, hurt me, and throw me away. I don&#8217;t know what it is to trust anymore. I can&#8217;t find my heart under the pain. Alessio found it. He touched it, and brought it alive again. But if he discovers just how dangerous I am to him&#8230;I&#8217;ll lose my life.</p>

<p>Summary : This broad cultural history of self-portraiture brilliantly maps the history of the genre, from the earliest myths of Narcissus and the Christian tradition of &#8220;bearing witness&#8221; to the prolific self-image-making of today&#8217;s contemporary artists. Focusing on a perennially popular subject, the book tells the vivid history of works that offer insights into artists&#8217; personal, psychological, and creative worlds. Topics include the importance of the medieval mirror craze in early self-portraiture; the confessional self-portraits of Titian and Michelangelo; the mystique of the artist&#8217;s studio, from Vermeer to Velazquez; the role of biography and geography for serial self-portraitists such as Courbet and Van Gogh; the multiple selves of modern and contemporary artists such as Cahun and Sherman; and recent developments in the era of globalization. Comprehensive and beautifully illustrated, the book features the work of a wide range of artists including Beckmann, Caravaggio, Durer, Gentileschi, </p>

<p>Summary : The brilliant but brooding new doctor encounters Copper Point&#8217;s sunny nurse-next-door&#8230; and nothing can stand in the way of this romance.Dr. Hong-Wei Wu has come to Copper Point, Wisconsin, after the pressures of a high-powered residency burned him out of his career before he started. Ashamed of letting his family down after all they?ve done for him, he plans to live a quiet life as a simple surgeon in this tiny northern town. His plans, however, don?t include his outgoing, kind, and attractive surgical nurse, Simon Lane.Simon wasn?t ready for the new surgeon to be a handsome charmer who keeps asking him for help getting settled and who woos him with amazing Taiwanese dishes. There?s no question?Dr. Wu is flirting with him, and Simon is flirting back. The problem is, St. Ann?s has a strict no-dating policy between staff, which means their romance is off the table? unless they bend the rules.?But a romance that keeps them?literally?in the closet can?t lead to happy ever after.

Nielsen returns to the world of The False Prince in this fourth book of the Ascendance Series!In a peaceful Carthya, Jaron leads as the Ascendant King with Imogen beside him &#8212; but the peace he fought so long for is not destined to last.On a routine sea voyage, Jaron&#8217;s ship is brutally attacked, and he is taken hostage. The mysterious captors and their leader, Jane Strick, accuse Jaron of unthinkable acts. They are also in possession of some shocking items &#8212; including the crown and sword that belonged to Jaron&#8217;s older brother, Darius. The items unearth a past Jaron thought he had put behind him.Though it seems impossible, Jaron must consider: Could Darius be alive? And what does Strick want from Jaron? Against his will, Jaron will be pulled back into a fight for the throne &#8212; and a battle to save his kingdom.</p>

<p>Summary : Feel like a hamster on a wheel, endlessly overwhelmed by your own thoughts and noisy brain? Do you lack focus on what&#8217;s important and feel daily anxiety? If you want clarity and peace of mind, this book is for you. All of us deal with an excessive amount of expectation surrounding us about what to do with our lives: become richer, lose weight, be a better person, think more positive, more more more&#8230; We have so many expectations, obligations, and duties and not enough energy to keep up with them. But do we really? Your greatest barrier to a better life is your own mind. The solution you&#8217;re seeking for is right in front of you. Clear Your Mind will help you to understand your thoughts, organize them and attach the appropriate action to them. Mental clarity equals peace of mind. The goal of this book is simple: free your mind from destructive thoughts, help you adopt new, constructive habits, and release you from tension. Your mind becomes more creative once released from burdens. </p>

But do we really? Your greatest barrier to a better life is your own mind. The solution you&#8217;re seeking for is right in front of you.

<p>Summary : Audiobook duration: 14 hours and 17 minutesHumans have three or four colour-detecting cones in their retinas. Mantis shrimp have 16. In fact, their eyes seem to have more in common with satellite technology than with biological vision as we currently understand it. They have evolved to track movement with an acuity no other species can match by processing raw information; they may not ?see?, in the human sense, at all.Marine molluscs called chitons have eyes that are made of stone. Scorpions appear to see with their entire bodies. It isn?t only vision that differs from species to species?some animals also have senses we lack entirely. Knifefish navigate by electrical charge.An Immense World will take us on an insider?s tour of the natural world by describing the biology, physics and chemistry animals use to perceive it. We may lack some of their senses, but our own super-sense lies in our ability to understand theirs. And in the face of the largest extinction event since the meteor </p>

<p>Summary : Buku ini mengisi kekosongan studi sejarah Darul Islam pasca kekalahan DI/TII pada 1962. Selama ini studi tentang gerakan yang mencita-citakan negara Islam di Indonesia, seperti yang dilakukan Cees van Dijk, K.D. Jackson, dan Holk H. Dengel, fokus pada periode sebelum itu. Melalui penelitian atas dokumen-dokumen pengadilan yang dikonfirmasi ulang melalui wawancara para tokoh DI dan JI (Jamaah Islamiyah) serta penelitian dokumen-dokumen internal milik kelompok ini, buku ini berhasil membuka jerohan gerakan Darul Islam pasca 1962 serta JI sebagai organisasi ?sempalan?? DI/TII. Berbagai kasus yang melibatkan gerakan jihad ini, yang selama ini masih samar, seperti? kasus Komando Jihad, Teror Warman, Gerakan Usroh, pelatihan militer di Afghanistan hingga Bom Bali 2002 dipaparkan dengan rinci dalam buku ini.</p>

<p>Summary : From USA Today bestselling author Parker S. Huntington comes an enemies-to-lovers, slow-burn romance full of revenge and a dash of fate.?She could enjoy her pretty, perfect world a little longer. Soon enough, everything she owned would be mine.?I had a plan to escape the friend zone.Step one: sneak into Reed?s room.Step two: sleep with him.But when the lights turned on, it wasn?t familiar blue eyes I saw.These were dark, angry, and full of demons.And they belonged to Reed?s much older brother.Four years later, Nash Prescott is no longer the help?s angry son.I?m no longer the town?s prized princess.At twenty-two, I?m broke, in need of a job.At thirty-two, he?s a billionaire, in need of revenge.Who cares if my family ruined his?Who cares if he looks at me with pure loathing?Who cares if every task he assigns me is designed to torture?I need the money.Simple as that.I?ll suffer his cruelty in silence, knowing there?s one thing he wants more than revenge?Me.Note: This is a 145,000-word </p>

<p>Summary : From USA Today bestselling author Parker S. Huntington comes an enemies-to-lovers, slow-burn romance full of revenge and a dash of fate.?She could enjoy her pretty, perfect world a little longer. Soon enough, everything she owned would be mine.?I had a plan to escape the friend zone.Step one: sneak into Reed?s room.Step two: sleep with him.But when the lights turned on, it wasn?t familiar blue eyes I saw.These were dark, angry, and full of demons.And they belonged to Reed?s much older brother.Four years later, Nash Prescott is no longer the help?s angry son.I?m no longer the town?s prized princess.At twenty-two, I?m broke, in need of a job.At thirty-two, he?s a billionaire, in need of revenge.Who cares if my family ruined his?Who cares if he looks at me with pure loathing?Who cares if every task he assigns me is designed to torture?I need the money.Simple as that.I?ll suffer his cruelty in silence, knowing there?s one thing he wants more than revenge?Me.Note: This is a 145,000-word </p>

<p>Summary : When the Jedi Order falls, an Inquisitor Rises.Padawan Iskat Akaris has dedicated her life to traveling the galaxy alongside her master, learning the ways of the Force to become a good Jedi. Despite Iskat?s dedication, peace and control have remained elusive, and with each setback, she feels her fellow Jedi grow more distrustful of her. Already uncertain about her future in the Jedi Order, Iskat faces tragedy when her master is killed and the Clone Wars engulf the galaxy in chaos.Now a general on the front lines contributing to that chaos, she is often reminded: Trust in your training. Trust in the wisdom of the Council. Trust in the Force. Yet as the shadows of doubt take hold, Iskat begins to ask questions that no Jedi is supposed to ask: Questions about her own unknown past. Questions the Jedi Masters would consider dangerous.As the years pass and the war endures, Iskat?s faith in the Jedi wanes. If they would grant her more freedom, she is certain she could do more to protect the </p>

<p>Summary : Can you live a lie?It?s a ghost town, this place that haunts me, the one that made me.It?s clear to me that I?ll never outgrow Triple Falls or outlive the time I spent here.I can still feel them all, my boys of summer.Even when I?d sensed the danger, I gave in.I didn?t heed a single warning. I let my sickness, my love, both rule and ruin me. I played my part, eyes wide open, tempting fate until it delivered.There was never going to be an escape.All of us are to blame for what happened. All of us serving our own sentences. We were careless and reckless, thinking our youth made us indestructible, exempt from our sins, and it cost us all.I?m done pretending I didn?t leave the largest part of me between these hills and valleys, between the sea of trees that hold my secrets.It?s the reason I?m back. To make peace with my fate.And if I can?t grieve enough to cure myself in my time here, I?ll remain sick. That will be my curse.But it?s time to confess, to myself more so than any other, that </p>

I let my sickness, my love, both rule and ruin me. I played my part, eyes wide open, tempting fate until it delivered.There was never going to be an escape.All of us are to blame for what happened. All of us serving our own sentences. We were careless and reckless, thinking our youth made us indestructible, exempt from our sins, and it cost us all.I?m done pretending I didn?t leave the largest part of me between these hills and valleys, between the sea of trees that hold my secrets.It?s the reason I?m back. To make peace with my fate.And if I can?t grieve enough to cure myself in my time here, I?ll remain sick. That will be my curse.But it?s time to confess, to myself more so than any other, that Discover the Bestseller Everyone is Talking About: Read Exodus (The Ravenhood, #2) PDF , Reading Exodus (The Ravenhood, #2) pdf , Exodus (The Ravenhood, #2) Handbook , Exodus (The Ravenhood, #2) read , Exodus (The Ravenhood, #2) epub , Exodus (The Ravenhood, #2) in English , Exodus (The Ravenhood, #2) Kindle , Exodus (The Ravenhood, #2) audiobook Exodus (The Ravenhood, #2) Summary.

<p>Summary : Waking Up to Our Capacity to Transform Ourselves and the World?? As we become more aware of various social injustices in the world, many of us want to be part of the movement toward positive change. But sometimes our best intentions cause unintended harm, and we fumble. We might feel afraid to say the wrong thing and feel guilt for not doing or knowing enough. Sometimes we might engage in performative allyship rather than thoughtful solidarity, leaving those already marginalized further burdened and exhausted. The feelings of fear, insecurity, inadequacy are all too common among a wide spectrum of changemakers, and they put many at a crossroads between feeling stuck and giving up, or staying grounded to keep going. So how can we go beyond performative allyship to creating real change in ourselves and in the world, together??In The Wake Up, Michelle MiJung Kim shares foundational principles often missing in today?s mainstream conversations around ?diversity and inclusion,? inviting </p>

<p>Summary : ?We are facing a species emergency. We can survive, but to do so will require a planned and deliberate migration of a kind humanity has never before undertaken. This is the biggest human crisis you?ve never heard of.?Drought-hit regions bleeding those for whom a rural life has become untenable. Coastlines diminishing year on year. Wildfires and hurricanes leaving widening swaths of destruction. The culprit, most of us accept, is climate change, but not enough of us are confronting one of its biggest, and most present, consequences: a total reshaping of the earth?s human geography. As Gaia Vince points out early in Nomad Century , global migration has doubled in the past decade, on track to see literal billions displaced in the coming decades. What exactly is happening, Vince asks? And how will this new great migration reshape us all?In this deeply-reported clarion call, Vince draws on a career of environmental reporting and over two years of travel to the front lines of climate </p>

Oh, and he happened to be my new boss.I should have signed my resignation with a giant kiss my ass the moment he opened his mouth, but I couldn?t.I fell for his little girls before I realized it was happening, and my resolve began to weaken.Our roles were clearly drawn out.He was the boss, and I was the nanny.But then we crossed a line.I wouldn?t lose my job over a chiseled jawline and a few stolen kisses.I couldn?t. Not when so much was at stake.But Liam was the one who made the rule book, and I had no choice but to play by his rules.</p>

But as he is drawn into a series of dreamlike and sometimes savage encounters &#8211; accompanied by, among others, Mozart, Goethe and the bewitching Hermione &#8211; the misanthropic Haller discovers a higher truth, and the possibility of happiness.</p>

If helping a sarcastic brunette make another guy jealous will help him secure his position on the team, he&#8217;s all for it. But when one unexpected kiss leads to the wildest sex of both their lives, it doesn&#8217;t take long for Garrett to realize that pretend isn&#8217;t going to cut </p>

<p>Summary : From the bestselling author of H is for Hawk, a brilliant and insightful work about our relationship to the natural worldOur world is a fascinating place, teeming not only with natural wonders that defy description, but complex interactions that create layers of meaning. Helen Macdonald is gifted with a special lens that seems to peer right through it all, and she shares her insights&#8211;at times startling, nostalgic, weighty, or simply entertaining&#8211;in this masterful collection of essays.From reflections on science fiction to the true story of an Iranian refugee&#8217;s flight to the UK, Macdonald has a truly omnivorous taste when it comes to observations of both the banal and sublime. Peppered throughout are reminisces of her own life, from her strange childhood in an estate owned by the Theosophical Society to watching total eclipses of the sun, visits to Uzbek solar power plants, eccentric English country shows, and desert hunting camps in the Gulf States.These essays move from personal </p>

<p>Summary : The Rest Is Noise: Listening to the Twentieth Century is a voyage into the labyrinth of modern music, which remains an obscure world for most people. While paintings of Picasso and Jackson Pollock sell for a hundred million dollars or more, and lines from T. S. Eliot are quoted on the yearbook pages of alienated teenagers across the land, twentieth-century classical music still sends ripples of unease through audiences. At the same time, its influence can be felt everywhere. Atonal chords crop up in jazz. Avant-garde sounds populate the soundtracks of Hollywood thrillers. Minimalism has had a huge effect on rock, pop, and dance music from the Velvet Underground onward.The Rest Is Noise shows why twentieth-century composers felt compelled to create a famously bewildering variety of sounds, from the purest beauty to the purest noise. It tells of a remarkable array of maverick personalities who resisted the cult of the classical past, struggled against the indifference of a wide public, </p>

<p>Summary : Decades? worth of images have been distilled down to 512 pages of photographs in this ultimate retrospective collection of Nobuyoshi Araki&#8217;s work, selected by the artist himself.First published as a Limited Edition and now back in a new format to celebrate TASCHEN?s 40th anniversary, the curation delves deep into Araki?s best-known imagery: Tokyo street scenes; faces and foods; colorful, sensual flowers; female genitalia; and the Japanese art of kinbaku, or bondage. As girls lay bound but defiant and glistening petals assume suggestive shapes, Araki plays constantly with patterns of subjugation and emancipation, death and desire and with the slippage between serene image and shock.Describing his bondage photographs as ?a collaboration between the subject and the photographer,? Araki seeks to come closer to his female subjects through photography, emphasizing the role of spoken conversation between himself and the model. In his native Japan, he has attained cult status for many women </p>

<p>Summary : The book begins by introducing the reader to a fantastic possibility &#8211; that humanity may be on the verge of a major shift in consciousness rooted in a new understanding of how our DNA operates &#8211; namely that it is programmed directly by the way we think and feel. This is a highly ambitious and sophisticated system for shaping one&#8217;s destiny. Based around 64 archetypes, it resembles the I Ching in its vast scope and profound importance, and in the resonant character of its symbolism. The author shows how there are two ways to approach the Gene Keys &#8211; the analogue (holistic) way and the digital (detailed) way. It is the combining of both analogue and digital that results in contemplation &#8211; the primary pathway into the Gene Keys. Since our beliefs shape our genes, when we change our beliefs, we change the chemistry of our body. The Gene Keys are an inner language whose central purpose is to transform our core beliefs about ourselves, thus raising our lives onto a new level of awareness. </p>

<p>Summary : Is an offender with mental health problems fully responsible for their offences? Should certain criminal behaviours be treated with incarceration and rehabilitation &#8211; or counselling and psychotherapy? Mad or Bad? asks these questions, and more.

<p>Summary : In this beautiful story of kindness and empathy, loneliness and love, one creature finds that the help he needs is just a song and a sigh away.Whale&#8217;s beautiful song winds its way through the ocean, reaching the farthest of faraways. His song is one of happiness and hope, magic and wonder&#8211;and Whale&#8217;s fellow sea creatures are calmed, cheered, and lulled by it. But though Whale sings his tender song day after day, night after night, Whale wonders why he has no song to fill his empty heart. So when he lets out a mournful sigh, the ocean carries it like a wish through its fathoms, bringing it to just the right place.Filled with stunning art and poetic language, this poignant story reminds us that being kind and helping a friend in need is sometimes the most beautiful thing of all.</p>

<p>Summary : At some point in nearly every marriage, a wife finds herself asking, What is wrong with my husband?! In David Finch&#8217;s case, this turns out to be an apt question. Five years after he married Kristen, the love of his life, they learn that he has Asperger syndrome. The diagnosis explains David?s ever-growing list of quirks and compulsions, his lifelong propensity to quack and otherwise melt down in social exchanges, and his clinical-strength inflexibility. But it doesn?t make him any easier to live with.Determined to change, David sets out to understand Asperger syndrome and learn to be a better husband?no easy task for a guy whose inability to express himself rivals his two-year-old daughter&#8217;s, who thinks his responsibility for laundry extends no further than throwing things in (or at) the hamper, and whose autism-spectrum condition makes seeing his wife&#8217;s point of view a near impossibility.Nevertheless, David devotes himself to improving his marriage with an endearing yet hilarious </p>

At seven, Claire had been barely old enough to know </p>

<p>Summary : When New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg centralized control of the citys schools in 2002, he terminated the citys 32-year experiment with decentralized school control dubbed by the mayor and the media as the Bad Old Days. Decentralization grew out of the community control movement of the 1960s, which was itself a response to the bad old days of central control of a school system that was increasingly segregated and unequal. In this probing historical account, Heather Lewis draws on new archival sources and oral histories to argue that the community control movement did influence school improvement, in particular African American and Puerto Rican communities in the 1970s and 80s. Lewis shows how educators with unique insights into the relationships between the schools and the communities they served enabled meaningful change, with a focus on instructional improvement and equity that would be familiar to many observers of contemporary education reform.

<p>Summary : Don?t Let Go!Hiro and the other parasites are granted a much-needed beach vacation.

While Zero Two balks at taking orders from anyone, Ichigo strives to be the leader that Squad 13 needs. When a new type of Klaxosaur arrives, will the squad be able to work together to take it down before it destroys the Plantation? Or will their emotions get the better of them?</p>

<p>Summary : When Quantum Physics expert Dr Chad Orzel went to adopt a dog he never imagined he would end up with one as inquisitive as Emmy. Could she use quantum tunnelling to get through the neighbour&#8217;s fence and chase bunnies? What about quantum teleportation to catch squirrels before they climb out of reach? In this witty and informative book, Orzel and Emmy &#8211; the talking dog &#8211; discuss the key theories of Quantum Physics and its fascinating history. From quarks and gluons to Heisenberg&#8217;s uncertainty principle, this is the perfect introduction to the fundamental laws which govern the universe.</p>

<p>Summary : ?Mohja Kahf ?s Hagar Poems is brilliantly original in its conception, thrillingly artful in its execution. Its range is immense, its spiritual depth is profound, it negotiates its shifts between archaic and the contemporary with utmost skill. There?s lyricism, there?s satire, there?s comedy, there?s theology of a high order in this book.??Alicia Ostriker, author of For the Love of God: The Bible as an Open Book?Hagar/ Hajar the immigrant/exile/outcast/refugee mother of a people is given multiple voices and significance in Mohja Kahf?s new book of dramatic monologues, which also reinvents Pharaoh?s daughter, Zuleika, A?sha, and Mary in poems that are at once lively and learned, agnostic and devout. The sequence on an American mosque, and the poet?s ambivalent love for what it represents, is unique in American poetry.??Marilyn Hacker, author of A Stranger?s Mirror??Where have all the goddesses gone,? writes Mohja Kahf, ?I tracked down Isis / incognito on Cyprus. /She told me Ishtar / </p>

<p>Summary : ?Mohja Kahf ?s Hagar Poems is brilliantly original in its conception, thrillingly artful in its execution. Its range is immense, its spiritual depth is profound, it negotiates its shifts between archaic and the contemporary with utmost skill. There?s lyricism, there?s satire, there?s comedy, there?s theology of a high order in this book.??Alicia Ostriker, author of For the Love of God: The Bible as an Open Book?Hagar/ Hajar the immigrant/exile/outcast/refugee mother of a people is given multiple voices and significance in Mohja Kahf?s new book of dramatic monologues, which also reinvents Pharaoh?s daughter, Zuleika, A?sha, and Mary in poems that are at once lively and learned, agnostic and devout. The sequence on an American mosque, and the poet?s ambivalent love for what it represents, is unique in American poetry.??Marilyn Hacker, author of A Stranger?s Mirror??Where have all the goddesses gone,? writes Mohja Kahf, ?I tracked down Isis / incognito on Cyprus. /She told me Ishtar / </p>

The stakes are high: there are vast fortunes to be made by whoever can take advantage of the octopuses? advancements, and as Dr. Nguyen struggles to communicate with the newly discovered species, forces larger than DIANIMA close </p>

Le lezioni sono arricchite da un complesso di fogli descriventi gli aspetti pi? propriamente lessicali della grammatica, vale a dire uso, senso e caratteristiche di parole e locuzioni che nell&#8217;articolazione della frase svolgono un ruolo essenziale.

Al fine di alleviare nei limiti del possibile la fatica di assimilazione e di sintesi, le lezioni sono fornite di riepiloghi grammaticali e lessicali in grado di scandire il ritmo e i tempi dei progressi compiuti.

<p>Summary : It?s a demon-eat-demon world for Nick Gautier. Just when he thinks he?s finally gotten a handle on how not to take over the world and destroy it, Death returns with an all-star cast that is determined to end the Malachai reign and lineage forever. Worse? Death and War have found the one, true enemy Nick can?t find, and even if he did, it?s one he could never bring himself to banish or kill.Now framed for murders he hasn?t committed, and surrounded by new friends who might be turncoats, Nick is learning fast how his father went down in flames.The heat in New Orleans is rising fast, and Nick?s threat-level has gone into a whole new level of intensity. He?s learning fast that when War and Death decide to battle, they don?t take prisoners. The don?t negotiate. And they?re both immune to his biting sarcasm and Cajun charm. To win this, he will have to embrace a new set of powers, but one wrong step, and he will belong to the side of Darkness, forever.</p>

To win this, he will have to embrace a new set of powers, but one wrong step, and he will belong to the side of Darkness, forever.</p>

<p>Summary : This history of modern Iran is not a survey in the conventional sense, but an ambitious exploration of the nation that offers a revealing look at how events, people, and institutions are shaped by trends and currents that sometimes reach back hundreds of years. Abbas Amanat covers the dynasties, revolutions, civil wars, foreign occupation, and new Islamic regime of this complex period in history. Amanat combines chronological and thematic approaches, exploring events with lasting implications for modern Iran and the world. Drawing on the latest historical scholarship and emphasizing the twentieth century in its coverage, the book addresses debates about Iran?s culture and politics. Political history is the driving focus of this narrative based on decades of research and study, which is layered with discussions of literature, music, and the arts; ideology and religion; economy and society; and cultural identity and heritage.</p>

<p>Summary : Rifqa is Mohammed El-Kurd?s debut collection of poetry, written in the tradition of Ghassan Kanfani?s Palestinian Resistance Literature. The book narrates the author?s own experience of dispossession in Sheikh Jarrah?an infamous neighborhood in Jerusalem, Palestine, whose population of refugees continues to live on the brink of homelessness at the hands of the Israeli government and US-based settler organizations. The book, named after the author?s late grandmother who was forced to flee from Haifa upon the genocidal establishment of Israel, makes the observation that home takeovers and demolitions across historical Palestine are not reminiscent of 1948 Nakba, but are in fact a continuation of it: a legalized, ideologically-driven practice of ethnic cleansing.</p>

<p>Summary : Bretonische Ferien und ein perfides VerbrechenZwischen den rosa Granitfelsen der C?te d?Armor steht Commissaire Dupin vor einer unl?sbaren Aufgabe: Es ist Hochsommer, und er soll Ferien machen. Am Strand liegen, die milde S??e des Lebens auskosten ? zwei Wochen lang. F?r Dupin eine unertr?gliche Vorstellung. Zum Gl?ck, muss man da fast sagen, verschwindet vor seinen Augen eine Frau. Und ein Verbrechen ungeahnten Ausma?es ersch?ttert das malerische ?rtchen Tr?gastel.W?hrend Claire die Ruhe zu genie?en scheint, nutzt Dupin jede Gelegenheit, das Strandhandtuch zu verlassen. Das fabelhafte Abendessen auf der Terrasse und die Ger?chte ?ber eine geklaute Heiligenstatue geh?ren zu den wenigen spannenden Momenten seiner Tage. Doch dann verschwindet eine Frau vor den Augen der Hotelg?ste spurlos und es wird ein Anschlag auf eine Abgeordnete ver?bt, die im Clinch mit den Landwirten liegt. Wenig sp?ter ersch?ttert der Fund einer Leiche den K?stenort. Heimlich nimmt Dupin mithilfe der </p>

<p>Summary : In Not the Israel My Parents Promised Me , one of the final graphic memoirs from the man who defined the genre, Harvey Pekar explores what it means to be Jewish and what Israel means to the Jews. Pekar&#8217;s mother was a Zionist by way of politics, his father by way of faith, and he inevitably grew up a staunch supporter of Israel. But as he became attuned to the wider world, Pekar began to question his parents&#8217; most fundamental beliefs.This book is the full account of that questioning. Over the course of a single day in his hometown of Cleveland, Ohio, Pekar and the illustrator JT Waldman wrestle with the mythologies passed down to them, weaving a personal and historical odyssey of uncommon wit and power. With an epilogue written by Joyce Brabner, Not the Israel My Parents Promised Me is an essential book for fans of Harvey Pekar and anyone interested in the past and future of the Jewish state.</p>

Da ugo?aj bude potpun svoj su doprinos dale i omiljene gostuju?e zvijezde, a uz njih, prvi je put progovorila i originalna ?Penny? Amanda Walsh.U ?Teoriji velikog praska? doista ?ete iz prve ruke doznati sve o izboru glumaca, romancama izvan seta, napornim pregovorima oko ugovora, smanjivanju pla?a, psihi?kim problemima i svemu onome ?to je dovelo do odluke o zavr?etku snimanja serije.Podsjetit ?ete se na najdra?e epizode, doznati hrpu tajni sa snimanja (kako se Penny preziva?) i u?ivati u nikad prije vi?enim fotografijama iz privatne arhive Kaley Cuoco.</p>

Unerschrocken treten sie eine Reise ins Unbekannte an, hinunter in das unterirdische Labyrinth, das st?ndig seine Form ver?ndert. Und hinter jeder Biegung lauern neue Gefahren &#8230;</p>
