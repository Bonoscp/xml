<p>Summary : Every leader is different; there is no one-size-fits-all solution that someone can copy. Leaders are human, with different personalities, personal preferences, and styles of communication, meaning that no two leaders can be the same. Instead of prescribing constrictive frameworks to force the reader into a cookie-cutter style of leadership, Leadership by Design acts as a mentor, guiding them towards finding their own unique style of leadership. This book is crafted as a self-development journey, providing the tools that one needs &#8211; no matter whether they?re a CEO, a community leader, a freelancer or something entirely different &#8211; to find out what leadership means to them. Balancing cutting-edge theory with useful tips, data, and tasks, this self-guided course will help facilitate a transformation towards becoming the type of leader the reader has always believed they can be.Nobody is born a leader &#8211; we grow to be one.</p>

This is one explanation for how Sheelu, a seventeen-year-old girl, ended up in jail after fleeing her service in the home of a powerful local legislator.

<p>Summary : In Uttar Pradesh?known as the &#8220;badlands&#8221; of India?a woman?s life is not entirely her own. This is one explanation for how Sheelu, a seventeen-year-old girl, ended up in jail after fleeing her service in the home of a powerful local legislator. In a region plagued by corruption, an incident like this might have gone unnoticed?except that it captured the attention of Sampat Pal, leader of India?s infamous Gulabi (Pink) Gang.Poor and illiterate, married off around the age of twelve, pregnant with her first child at fifteen, and prohibited from attending school, Sampat Pal has risen to become the courageous commander and chief of a women?s brigade numbering in the tens of thousands.

<p>Summary : #1 New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood returns with a novel of family drama, suspense, and?of course?romance.   Peyton Lockhart and her sisters have inherited Bishop?s Cove, a small, luxurious oceanfront resort, but it comes with a condition: The girls must run the resort for one year and show a profit?only then will they own it.  A graduate of a prestigious French culinary school, Peyton has just lost her job as a food critic. Out of work and in a bad place personally, a year doing something completely different sounds wonderful.  There are countless challenges and too many people who want to stop the sisters from succeeding. Among them are Peyton?s contentious cousins, who are outraged that they didn?t inherit the resort, as well as a powerful group of land developers who have been eyeing the coveted beachfront property.  It?s soon apparent to Peyton that their efforts are being sabotaged, but she refuses to let the threats scare her?until she?s nearly killed. She calls </p>

<p>Summary : Money. Family. Love. Hate. Obsession. Duty. Politics. Religion &#8211; or the lack thereof. Sex &#8212; or, once again, the lack thereof. Thomas Baldwin finds himself married to a woman he can&#8217;t stand, while head-over heels in love with another woman he can&#8217;t have. Talk about bad planning. As if the twists and turns of his personal life don?t create enough tension, an unending string of disasters &#8211; the railroad riots of 1877, the creation of the Homestead Steel Works, the assassination of President Garfield, and the Johnstown Flood ? keep him wondering if his life will ever stop spiraling out of control.Only his muse ? lovely, warm, and heartbreaking ? gives him the maddening feel that perhaps there is a way off the rollercoaster.</p>

<p>Summary : Education has the potential to open incredible doors of opportunity for students. Yet despite unprecedented levels of public school funding and numerous reforms, far too many young people in America s school system today never enjoy the opportunities afforded to students by a quality education. In Education and Opportunity, Michael McShane proposes a market-based approach to education one that fosters innovation and encourages competition, through charter schools, education savings accounts, and school choice. However, liberalization of the system is not enough.

<p>Summary : Being &amp; Nothingness is without doubt one of the most significant philosophical books of the 20th century. The central work by one of the century&#8217;s most influential thinkers, it altered the course of western philosophy. Its revolutionary approach challenged all previous assumptions about the individual&#8217;s relationship with the world. Known as &#8216;the Bible of existentialism&#8217;, its impact on culture &amp; literature was immediate &amp; was felt worldwide, from the absurdist drama of Samuel Beckett to the soul-searching cries of the Beat poets.Being &amp; Nothingness is one of those rare books whose influence has affected the mindset of subsequent generations. Seventy years after its 1st publication, its message remains as potent as ever&#8211;challenging readers to confront the fundamental dilemmas of human freedom, choice, responsibility &amp; action.</p>

<p>Summary : Aprile 1945. Col finire della guerra il commissario De Luca vuol prendere le distanze dal proprio passato nella polizia politica e adesso indaga proprio su quei crimini comuni, che in tempi di dissoluzione di un regime passano senz?altro in secondo piano. Ma le cose non vanno come ci si aspetta. Nulla ? scontato, nulla obbedisce al modello di una trama ben confezionata di cui l?autore sa gi? tutto. Sembra anzi che Lucarelli sia l?, appena un passo davanti a noi, ansioso quanto noi di scoprire dove diavolo lo porti il suo personaggio, a quale rivelazione di s?. Pu? darsi che l?indagine porti lontano, proprio in quel mondo febbrile di corruzione e traffici loschi che ben si sposa con la fine di una dittatura. Pu? darsi che porti a scoprire qualcosa che ci appartiene profondamente come italiani, e che forse non ? mai passato, forse ? ancora l? che aspetta. E anche De Luca ? con noi, con la sua malinconia, con quello che pu? apparire perfino cinismo, e invece ? solo la consapevolezza </p>

<p>Summary : A project-based guide to the basics of deep learning.This concise, project-driven guide to deep learning takes readers through a series of program-writing tasks that introduce them to the use of deep learning in such areas of artificial intelligence as computer vision, natural-language processing, and reinforcement learning. The author, a longtime artificial intelligence researcher specializing in natural-language processing, covers feed-forward neural nets, convolutional neural nets, word embeddings, recurrent neural nets, sequence-to-sequence learning, deep reinforcement learning, unsupervised models, and other fundamental concepts and techniques. Students and practitioners learn the basics of deep learning by working through programs in Tensorflow, an open-source machine learning framework. ?I find I learn computer science material best by sitting down and writing programs,? the author writes, and the book reflects this approach.Each chapter includes a programming project, </p>

<p>Summary : Sixteen-year-old Sana Kiyohara has too many secrets. Some are small, like how it bothers her when her friends don?t invite her to parties. Some are big, like that fact that she?s pretty sure her father?s having an affair. And then there?s the one that she barely even admits to herself, the one about how she might have a crush on her best friend.When Sana and her family move to California, she begins to wonder if it?s finally time for her to be honest with her friends and family, especially after she meets Jamie Ramirez. Jamie is beautiful and smart and unlike anyone Sana?s ever known before. The only problems are: Sana is pretty sure Jamie?s friends hate her, Jamie?s ex isn?t totally out of the picture, Sana?s new friend Caleb has more-than-friendly feelings for her, and things with her dad feel like they?re coming to a head. She always figured that the hardest thing would be to tell people that she wanted to date a girl, but as she quickly learns, telling the truth is easy?what </p>

<p>Summary : Sixteen-year-old Sana Kiyohara has too many secrets. Some are small, like how it bothers her when her friends don?t invite her to parties. Some are big, like that fact that she?s pretty sure her father?s having an affair. And then there?s the one that she barely even admits to herself, the one about how she might have a crush on her best friend.When Sana and her family move to California, she begins to wonder if it?s finally time for her to be honest with her friends and family, especially after she meets Jamie Ramirez. Jamie is beautiful and smart and unlike anyone Sana?s ever known before. The only problems are: Sana is pretty sure Jamie?s friends hate her, Jamie?s ex isn?t totally out of the picture, Sana?s new friend Caleb has more-than-friendly feelings for her, and things with her dad feel like they?re coming to a head. She always figured that the hardest thing would be to tell people that she wanted to date a girl, but as she quickly learns, telling the truth is easy?what </p>

<p>Summary : Born with low vision, Blake has grown up preferring routines and disliking changes. Keeping everything the same is safer and helps him keep his independence. A visit to Grandma?s house shakes his world. Werewolves, fairies, and gods like Loki are all real, but he doesn?t want anything to do with them, and he certainly doesn?t want to bond with a werewolf. Can Blake learn to accept changes and grow with them, or will he lose his chance at true love and possibly his life?This M/M monster fairy tale contains explicit material including light bondage, rimming, knotting, and anal sex. Reader discretion is advised. This contains the Loki from the novella, Loki?s Price, which is not required to understand Little Red Riding Hood.</p>

Changes to the fourth edition include: a new chapter on the changing healthcare environment, providing rich context for future healthcare marketing activities; a new chapter addressing health </p>

<p>Summary : Aaron Dignan helps his clients get unstuck by teaching them how to eliminate red tape, tap into collective intelligence, and rethink long-held traditions that no longer make sense. Now he shows us how to do the same.Are you and your colleagues frustrated by policies that slow you down? Unsure how to reorganize for an era of uncertainty? Overwhelmed by the sheer complexity of your organization? Afraid your team will lose its culture as it grows? Distracted from real work by the deluge of meetings and email?You&#8217;re not alone &#8212; and Aaron Dignan can show you a better way. He helps companies around the world use a proven process to become much less bureaucratic and rigid. His book is packed with new tactics and strategies for updating your company&#8217;s operating system: the fundamental assumptions so deeply embedded that we don&#8217;t even think to question them (e.g. budgets should be done annually; employees need finanical incentives; marketers should sit with marketers).Dignan illuminates </p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  A profound exploration of the spiritual power of nature&#8211;and an urgent call to reclaim that power in everyday life. <br />
Since the beginning of time, humankind has looked upon nature and seen the divine. In the writings of the great thinkers across religions, the natural world inspires everything from fear to awe to tranquil contemplation; God, or however one defined the sublime, was present in everything. Yet today, even as we admire a tree or take in a striking landscape, we rarely see nature as sacred.In this short but deeply powerful book, the bestselling historian of religion Karen Armstrong re-sacralizes nature for modern times. Drawing on her vast knowledge of the world&#8217;s religious traditions, she vividly describes nature&#8217;s central place in spirituality across the centuries. In bringing this age-old wisdom to life, Armstrong shows modern readers how to rediscover nature&#8217;s potency and form a connection to something greater than ourselves.</p>

When she steps off the train and locks eyes with her betrothed, she immediately feels drawn to him. But the cowboy standing before her isn?t Dallas.

<p>Summary : <br />
  He?s fallen for a woman?? <br />
Anxious to meet her soon-to-be-husband, Dallas Leigh for the first time, mail-order bride Amelia Carson is en route to Fort Worth, Texas.

<p>Summary : Violent Inheritance deepens the analysis of settler colonialism&#8217;s endurance in the North American West and how infrastructures that ground sexual modernity are both reproduced and challenged by publics who have inherited them. E Cram redefines sexual modernity through extractivism, wherein sexuality functions to extract value from life including land, air, minerals, and bodies. Analyzing struggles over memory cultures through the region&#8217;s land use controversies at the turn of and well into the twentieth century, Cram unpacks the consequences of western settlement and the energy regimes that fueled it. Transfusing queer eco-criticism with archival and ethnographic research, Cram reconstructs the linkages?&#8221;land lines&#8221;?between infrastructure, violence, sexuality, and energy and shows how racialized sexual knowledges cultivated settler colonial cultures of both innervation and enervation.

<p>Summary : There are moments when you think life is going one way and a major curveball sends you the complete opposite direction. That?s me, standing in the rain, wondering how things went so terribly wrong. What do I need? To hide at my brother?s house to lick my wounds.What do I get? My brother?s roommate, sexy-as-sin best friend, Carter Kennedy.The cute, adventurous boy who was my teenage crush. The inspiring, irresistible man who will never be mine. But then things get complicated with fun-filled days and pleasure-filled nights. If Carter wasn?t the most commitment-phobic person I know, I could consider the clich? of dating my brother?s best friend. But he will never fit the husband checklist I made to find the man who will be my world, and I?m not willing to compromise on that. At least, that&#8217;s the plan.</p>

BrodyFor years I buried my feelings for my best friend, Skye, because she needed my friendship more than anything else.Now she?s decided she?s finally ready to take a chance on falling in love.Just&#8230; not with me.But I refuse to stand by and watch her fall for another man. Not when I know we?re perfect for each other.So, when we end up trapped in a snowed-in cabin, I use the opportunity to show Skye exactly how good we can be together.SkyeGetting stuck in a cabin with my best friend shouldn?t have been a big deal.But that was before he let me know exactly how he feels about me.I?ve had a good reason for never letting myself see Brody as anything more than a friend, though. And I?m fighting this attraction with everything I have.Only, I?m not sure I?m going to win. Because Brody is determined to make me his.And I?ve got a feeling he won?t go down without a fight.Wishing for Always is a </p>

<p>Summary : Earth. A world quarantined since its discovery by the Far-Reachers of Jota&#8217;s history. And where the fortunes of slavers and chemists have been made ever since.It was to Earth that Kanetus E&#8217;Var, the son of Jota&#8217;s most ruthless slaver, escaped to make Vahst, a powerful drug manufactured from the human brain. And it was to Earth that Tagen Pahnee, Fourth-ranking officer of the Jotan Off-World Security Fleet, was sent to bring the criminal back to justice. Neither of them could have anticipated that at that moment, E&#8217;Var&#8217;s hunting grounds were experiencing the worst heat wave in years, triggering the Jotan breeding cycle in both males.Home is not an option for either of them. Both are determined to find a way to work on this hostile planet, surrounded by humans, surrounded by dangers, surrounded by Heat.Adult readers only, due to graphic gore, violence, and explicit sexual situations.617 pages, 285,862 words</p>

<p>Summary : The late Queeny Chang led an extraordinary life. Her autobiography, first published in 1981, introduces readers to a time when ladies led a genteel way of life. In this book, Queeny Chang presents a vision of a way of life that has long since vanished. Her tender memoir opens the windows of time and allows the images of the old world charm of the early 1900s to be seen again. She paints colourful portraits of her family, relatives, and many friends, particularly of her strong-minded but fastidious and flamboyant mother. What she had to say to her life with her famous father, the late Mr. Tjong A Fie (a prominent businessman and leader of the Chinese community in Medan, Indonesia) is both fascinating and touching. Here is a story of a gentle woman, very real, warm and sincere.</p>

<p>Summary : In twenty short books, Penguin Classics brings you the ideas that have changed the way we think and talk about the living Earth.In Hot Money Naomi Klein lays out the evidence that deregulated capitalism is waging war on the climate, and shows that, in order to stop the damage, we must change everything we think about how our world is run.Over the past 75 years, a new canon has emerged. As life on Earth has become irrevocably altered by humans, visionary thinkers around the world have raised their voices to defend the planet, and affirm our place at the heart of its restoration. Their words have endured through the decades, becoming the classics of a movement. Together, these books show the richness of environmental thought, and point the way to a fairer, saner, greener world.</p>

<p>Summary : Rising young comedian Moshe Kasher is lucky to be alive. He started using drugs when he was just 12. At that point, he had already been in psychoanlysis for 8 years. By the time he was 15, he had been in and out of several mental institutions, drifting from therapy to rehab to arrest to&#8230;you get the picture. But KASHER IN THE RYE is not an &#8220;eye opener&#8221; to the horrors of addiction. It&#8217;s a hilarious memoir about the absurdity of it all.When he was a young boy, Kasher&#8217;s mother took him on a vacation to the West Coast. Well it was more like an abduction. Only not officially. She stole them away from their father and they moved to Oakland , California. That&#8217;s where the real fun begins, in the war zone of Oakland Public Schools. He was more than just out of control-his mother walked him around on a leash, which he chewed through and ran away.Those early years read like part Augusten Burroughs, part David Sedaris, with a touch of Jim Carrol&#8230;but a lot more Jewish. In fact, Kasher later </p>

<p>Summary : ?k?, the spirit of Lagos, and his loyal minion Tatafo weave trouble through the streets of Lagos and through the lives of the ?vagabonds? powering modern Nigeria: the queer, the displaced and the footloose.With Tatafo as our guide we meet these people in the shadows. Among them are a driver for a debauched politician; a lesbian couple whose tender relationship sheds unexpected light on their experience with underground sex work; a mother who attends a secret spiritual gathering that shifts her reality. As their lives begin to intertwine?in markets and underground clubs, in churches and hotel rooms?the vagabonds are seized and challenged by the spirits who command the city.

<p>Summary : ?Waypoints is a memoir with a difference! I wanted to tell the stories and share the experiences that have shaped me, but to do that I needed to challenge myself and spend some time in my own company, away from the distractions of everyday life. And for me there&#8217;s no better place to reflect than in the wild Scottish Highlands.?In this journey of self-discovery, Sam Heughan sets out along the West Highland Way to explore his heritage and reflect on the personal waypoints that define him. The result is a love letter to the wild Scottish landscape that means so much to Sam, and a charming, funny, wise and searching insight to the world through his eyes. The walk itself is the backdrop for this narrative, which tells the story of Sam&#8217;s life while exploring his outlook, values and interests. Sam is a figure of fascinating contrasts, a Hollywood star with deep roots in rural Scotland, he&#8217;s both outgoing and content in his own company. He has strong connections with his fans while </p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  An instructive guide to creating an illustrated journal based on artist and Instagram sensation Samantha Dion Baker&#8217;s unique creative process, featuring information on materials, creative inspiration and instruction, prompts, and helpful tips and tricks. <br />
Samantha Dion Baker is a widely admired and followed artist on Instagram, where she shares her &#8220;sketch journal,&#8221; an illustrated daily record of her life, drawn in a fresh, modern style. In Draw Your Day, Baker guides you through her inspirational practice and provides guidance for starting your own. Part instructional guide and part encouraging manifesto about how making art&#8211;even art that&#8217;s not museum-worthy&#8211;can make your life more mindful and meaningful, Draw Your Day is ideal for both seasoned artists looking for fresh inspiration, as well as aspiring artists who need a friendly nudge to get started.</p>

<p>Summary : Whether it is the TV commercial that breaks into our favorite program, or the telemarketing phone call that disrupts a family dinner, traditional advertising is based on the hope of snatching our attention away from whatever we are doing. Seth Godin calls this Interruption Marketing, and, as companies are discovering, it no longer works. Instead of annoying potential customers by interrupting their most coveted commodity -time- Permission Marketing offers consumers incentives to accept advertising voluntarily. Now this Internet pioneer introduces a fundamentally different way of thinking about advertising products and services. By reaching out only to those individuals who have signaled an interest in learning more about a product, Permission Marketing enables companies to develop long-term relationships with customers, create trust, build brand awareness, and greatly improve the chances of making a sale.</p>

<p>Summary : Winner of the 2011 National Book Award for Fiction A hurricane is building over the Gulf of Mexico, threatening the coastal town of Bois Sauvage, Mississippi, and Esch&#8217;s father is growing concerned. A hard drinker, largely absent, he doesn&#8217;t show concern for much else. Esch and her three brothers are stocking food, but there isn&#8217;t much to save. Lately, Esch can&#8217;t keep down what food she gets; she&#8217;s fourteen and pregnant. Her brother Skeetah is sneaking scraps for his prized pitbull&#8217;s new litter, dying one by one in the dirt, while brothers Randall and Junior try to stake their claim in a family long on child&#8217;s play and short on parenting. As the twelve days that comprise the novel&#8217;s framework yield to the final day and Hurricane Katrina, the unforgettable family at the novel&#8217;s heart?motherless children sacrificing for each other as they can, protecting and nurturing where love is scarce?pulls itself up to struggle for another day.

<p>Summary : This book covers 250 years of painting in Spain starting with works created at the splendid sixteenth-century court of Philip II to those produced at the Hapsburg and Bourbon courts of Madrid, and in the cities of Seville, Valencia, and Toledo. The result was an art of extraordinary stature and international scope. With the aid of 116 illustrations, most in color, Janis Tomlinson traces the myriad influences reflected in the paintings of generations of artists from Sofonisba Anguissola, El Greco, Vel?squez, and Zubar?n to the unique accomplishment of Francisco Goya.</p>

One life-changing music festival.Toni is grieving the loss of her roadie father and needing to figure out where her life will go from here &#8212; and she&#8217;s desperate to get back to loving music. Olivia is a hopeless romantic whose heart has just taken a beating (again) and is beginning to feel like she&#8217;ll always be a square peg in a round hole &#8212; but the Farmland Music and Arts Festival is a chance to find a place where she fits.The two collide and it feels like something like kismet when a bond begins to form. But when something goes wrong and the festival is sent into a panic, Olivia and Toni will find that they need each other (and music) more than they ever imagined.</p>

Tears of the Desert is the first memoir ever written by a woman caught up in the war in Darfur. It is a survivor&#8217;s tale of a conflicted country, a resilient people, and the uncompromising spirit of a young woman who refused to be silenced.Born into the Zaghawa tribe in the Sudanese desert, Halima was doted on by her father, a cattle herder, and kept in line by her formidable grandmother. A politically astute man, Halima&#8217;s father saw to it that his daughter received a good education away from their rural surroundings. Halima excelled in her studies and exams, surpassing even the privileged Arab girls who looked down their noses at the black Africans. With her love of learning and her father&#8217;s support, Halima went on to study medicine, and at twenty-four became her village&#8217;s first formal doctor.Yet not even the symbol of good luck that dotted </p>

<p>Summary : Zera is a Heartless ? the immortal, unageing soldier of a witch. Bound to the witch Nightsinger ever since she saved her from the bandits who murdered her family, Zera longs for freedom from the woods they hide in. With her heart in a jar under Nightsinger?s control, she serves the witch unquestioningly.Until Nightsinger asks Zera for a Prince?s heart in exchange for her own, with one addendum; if she?s discovered infiltrating the court, Nightsinger will destroy her heart rather than see her tortured by the witch-hating nobles.Crown Prince Lucien d?Malvane hates the royal court as much as it loves him ? every tutor too afraid to correct him and every girl jockeying for a place at his darkly handsome side. No one can challenge him ? until the arrival of Lady Zera. She?s inelegant, smart-mouthed, carefree, and out for his blood. The Prince?s honor has him quickly aiming for her throat.So begins a game of cat and mouse between a girl with nothing to lose and a boy who has it all.Winner </p>

<p>Summary : After Rain Falls is BOOK TWO OF TWO in the River of Rain Duet. In order to understand the contents of this book, you must read Follow the River first. This is the conclusion of River and Rain&#8217;s story.Love has never been important to me. Not because I didn&#8217;t want it, I just never imagined feeling something so powerful.There was a point where I thought I felt it years ago for the person I trusted most in the world, only to have it shatter in a thousand pieces.But now he&#8217;s back in my life and I&#8217;m certain I was wrong.Because nothing compares to the way I feel about River Lennox.Nothing could have prepared me for the war we waged against one another to turn into a battle to not only find ourselves, but each other.Our prison sentence became our sanctuary from anything&#8211;or anyone&#8211;who dared to rip us apart.He crawled under my skin, into my heart, and made a home for himself there despite my efforts to stop him.But it doesn&#8217;t matter now. Not when I find myself being thrown into a chess game </p>

Not because I didn&amp;#8217;t want it, I just never imagined feeling something so powerful.There was a point where I thought I felt it years ago for the person I trusted most in the world, only to have it shatter in a thousand pieces.But now he&amp;#8217;s back in my life and I&amp;#8217;m certain I was wrong.Because nothing compares to the way I feel about River Lennox.Nothing could have prepared me for the war we waged against one another to turn into a battle to not only find ourselves, but each other.Our prison sentence became our sanctuary from anything&amp;#8211;or anyone&amp;#8211;who dared to rip us apart.He crawled under my skin, into my heart, and made a home for himself there despite my efforts to stop him.But it doesn&amp;#8217;t matter now.

Dr. Durant worked on it steadily from 1927 to 1932, &amp; the book represents the third complete rewriting.

The story is carried up to mid-30s. The Story of Civilization represents the most comprehensive attempt in our times to embrace the vast panorama of human history &amp; culture.</p>

<p>Summary : A magnificently illustrated Chinese folklore tale about a tigress, a seer, a King, and the prince, who must leave his family and learn the ways of the tigers so that the war between man and animal can end.Deep in the Great Forest, a tigress is mourning the death of her tiger babies who have been killed by hunters. Seeking revenge, she attacks the villages, destroying houses and prompting the King to gather his army together. But a seer named Lao Lao warns the King that if he angers the tigress further she will destroy the kingdom. Lao Lao counsels the King to give his own son to the tigress and promises that no harm will come to the prince. The next morning, the king brings the boy prince to the edge of the Great Forest and tells him, &#8220;Now you must go on alone.&#8221; To end the war between man and animal, the prince must forget his human ways and begin to learn what tigers know.

<p>Summary : If humanity cannot live with the dangers and responsibilities inherent in freedom, it will probably turn to authoritarianism. This is the central idea of Escape from Freedom, a landmark work by one of the most distinguished thinkers of our time, and a book that is as timely now as when first published in 1941. Few books have thrown such light upon the forces that shape modern society or penetrated so deeply into the causes of authoritarian systems. If the rise of democracy set some people free, at the same time it gave birth to a society in which the individual feels alienated and dehumanized. Using the insights of psychoanalysis as probing agents, Fromm&#8217;s work analyzes the illness of contemporary civilization as witnessed by its willingness to submit to totalitarian rule.</p>

<p>Summary : If humanity cannot live with the dangers and responsibilities inherent in freedom, it will probably turn to authoritarianism. This is the central idea of Escape from Freedom, a landmark work by one of the most distinguished thinkers of our time, and a book that is as timely now as when first published in 1941. Few books have thrown such light upon the forces that shape modern society or penetrated so deeply into the causes of authoritarian systems. If the rise of democracy set some people free, at the same time it gave birth to a society in which the individual feels alienated and dehumanized. Using the insights of psychoanalysis as probing agents, Fromm&#8217;s work analyzes the illness of contemporary civilization as witnessed by its willingness to submit to totalitarian rule.</p>

<p>Summary : This deluxe edition features twenty-four brand-new illustrations by Stefano Martino, Alvaro Sarraseca, Andres Ponce, and German Ponce in an intricately designed foil-stamped hardcover!Empress Celene of Orlais rose to the throne of the most powerful nation in Thedas through wisdom, wit, and ruthless manipulation. Now, the empire she has guided into an age of enlightenment is threatened from within by imminent war between the templars and the mages, even as rebellion stirs among the downtrodden elves To save Orlais, Celene must keep her hold on the throne by any means necessary.Fighting with the legendary skill of the Orlesian Chevaliers , Grand Duke Gaspard has won countless battles for the empire and the empress But has he fought in vain? As the Circle fails and chaos looms, Gaspard begins to doubt that Celene?s diplomatic approach to the mage problem or the elven uprisings will keep the empire safe.

<p>Summary : Love is the greatest gamble of all . . .  Nina Sheridan desperately needs a timeout vacation. With a fiance who can&#8217;t even remember how she takes her coffee, Nina wants some distance to rethink her engagement. Flying halfway around the world from England to a mountain town in Colorado should do the trick. But when she finds a gorgeous man at her rental cabin, Nina&#8217;s cold, lonely adventure suddenly heats up. The owner of the house, Holden &#8220;Max&#8221; Maxwell is surprised by the beautiful woman who turns up at his door. But when Nina becomes ill, Max spends days nursing her back to health. A private man with a broken heart, Max finds himself drawn to the strong-willed woman. Soon it becomes impossible for Nina and Max to deny their growing attraction to one another. Yet even as these two wounded lovebirds think about taking a chance on a relationship, a dangerous secret from Max&#8217;s past emerges-and threatens to end their love for good.</p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  In the first picture book written by a DACA dreamer, Areli Morales tells her own powerful and vibrant immigration story. <br />
When Areli was just a baby, her mama and papa moved from Mexico to New York with her brother, Alex, to make a better life for the family&#8211;and when she was in kindergarten, they sent for her, too.Everything in New York was different. Gone were the Saturdays at Abuela&#8217;s house, filled with cousins and sunshine. Instead, things were busy and fast and noisy. Areli&#8217;s limited English came out wrong, and schoolmates accused her of being illegal. But time passed, and Areli slowly became a New Yorker&#8211;although not an American citizen. I could do anything here, Areli says one day to the city sky. Someday, I will.This is a moving story&#8211;one that resonates with millions of immigrants who make up the fabric of our country&#8211;about one girl living in two worlds, a girl whose DACA application was eventually approved and who is now living her American dream.</p>

<p>Summary : Yusuf Azeem has spent all his life in the small town of Frey, Texas?and nearly that long waiting for the chance to participate in the regional robotics competition, which he just knows he can win.Only, this year is going to be more difficult than he thought. Because this year is the twentieth anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, an anniversary that has everyone in his Muslim community on edge.With ?Never Forget? banners everywhere and a hostile group of townspeople protesting the new mosque, Yusuf realizes that the country?s anger from two decades ago hasn?t gone away. Can he hold onto his joy?and his friendships?in the face of heartache and prejudice?</p>

<p>Summary : The story of a boy who dreamed of becoming a man? But dreamed up a monster instead.You?re on the run. Marked. Don?t think about the kid you used to be when you?re homeless and dumpster-diving in the rain. Just eat whatever you find to keep your engine full. Because the shadow with too many teeth wants you tired.You?re easier to catch when you?re tired.It has hunted you since the summer of 1994, back when we confessed who we were through mixtapes. When every movie at the video store had dirty heads. You were thirteen and thought you knew who you were. Only the shadow with too many teeth knew you better. It still does. And it won?t stop. Not until you come home.Back to where it all began.Part cosmic horror, part coming-of-age monster story, DIRTY HEADS is a terrifying read from the author of HOUSE OF SIGHS, THE FALLEN BOYS, and A PLACE FOR SINNERS</p>

Las familias senatoriales han desatado su ambici?n y todas ellas se embarcan en una incansable lucha por el poder en la que nada ni nadie ser? respetado.Entretanto, el centro de operaciones militares se traslada a Hispania, donde el rebelde lusitano Viriato humilla a las legiones y donde se elevan los enormes fuegos de la rebeli?n celt?bera y de la extraordinaria y ?pica resistencia de una ciudad irreductible: Numantia. Es tambi?n el tiempo de Tiberio Sempronio Graco, nieto de Escipi?n Africano e hijo de Cornelia, una mujer fuera de lo com?n. El joven Graco abanderar? una conflictiva reforma que sacudir? los cimientos del Senado y de la Rep?blica misma.Tras El primer senador de Roma, Juan Torres Zalba nos sumerge en Numantia en una novela formidable que, de la mano de las m?s grandes figuras hist?ricas, rebosa epopeya, </p>

<p>Summary : Flowers occupy a special role in Indian culture, history, myth and tradition. From the most elevated space of the sacred to adornment in everyday life, there is a flower for every season, every reason and a special one for the numerous gods and goddesses of Indian religion. Flowers?as offerings during ritual worship to intricate carvings on temple walls, embedded in modern paintings by contemporary artists to colourful carpets for welcoming gods and guests, from fragrant garlands that adorn Indian brides and grooms to aromatic essential oils and perfumes, used as a play of seduction in the Kamasutra?they refresh our spirits and elevate our souls.Flower Shower explores this integral role that flowers play in our world. Discussing a range of topics from botany to aesthetics and history to poetry, the author takes you through an immersive journey, laden with the beauty and perfumes of the exotic, nutritional and decorative role of flowers within Indian tradition and aesthetics?</p>

<p>Summary : Questo volume nasce da un progetto di rilettura del poema omerico destinato alla scena teatrale. Baricco smonta e rimonta l&#8217;Iliade creando ventun monologhi, corrispondenti ad altrettanti personaggi del poema e al personaggio di un aedo che racconta, in chiusura, l&#8217;assedio e la caduta di Troia. L&#8217;autore &#8220;rinuncia&#8221; agli dei e punta sulle figure che si muovono sulla terra, sui campi di battaglia, nei palazzi achei, dietro le mura della citt? assediata. Tema nodale di questa sequenza di monologhi ? la guerra, la guerra come desiderio, destino, fascinazione, condanna. Un&#8217;operazione teatrale e letteraria insieme, dalla quale emerge un intenso sapore di attualizzazione, riviviscenza, urgenza, anche morale e civile.</p>

<p>Summary : The story of two refugee families and their hope and resilience as they fight to survive and belong in AmericaThe welcoming and acceptance of immigrants and refugees has been central to America&#8217;s identity for centuries&#8211;yet America has periodically turned its back at the times of greatest humanitarian need. After the Last Border is an intimate look at the lives of two women as they struggle for the twenty-first century American dream, having won the &#8220;golden ticket&#8221; to settle as refugees in Austin, Texas.Mu Naw, a Christian from Myanmar struggling to put down roots with her family, was accepted after decades in a refugee camp at a time when America was at its most open to displaced families; and Hasna, a Muslim from Syria, agrees to relocate as a last resort for the safety of her family&#8211;only to be cruelly separated from her children by a sudden ban on refugees from Muslim countries. Writer and activist Jessica Goudeau tracks the human impacts of America&#8217;s ever-shifting refugee policy </p>

After the Last Border is an intimate look at the lives of two women as they struggle for the twenty-first century American dream, having won the &amp;#8220;golden ticket&amp;#8221; to settle as refugees in Austin, Texas.Mu Naw, a Christian from Myanmar struggling to put down roots with her family, was accepted after decades in a refugee camp at a time when America was at its most open to displaced families; and Hasna, a Muslim from Syria, agrees to relocate as a last resort for the safety of her family&amp;#8211;only to be cruelly separated from her children by a sudden ban on refugees from Muslim countries. Writer and activist Jessica Goudeau tracks the human impacts of America&amp;#8217;s ever-shifting refugee policy Discover the Bestseller Everyone is Talking About: Read After the Last Border: Two Families and the Story of Refuge in America PDF , Reading After the Last Border: Two Families and the Story of Refuge in America pdf , After the Last Border: Two Families and the Story of Refuge in America Handbook , After the Last Border: Two Families and the Story of Refuge in America read , After the Last Border: Two Families and the Story of Refuge in America epub , After the Last Border: Two Families and the Story of Refuge in America in English , After the Last Border: Two Families and the Story of Refuge in America Kindle , After the Last Border: Two Families and the Story of Refuge in America audiobook After the Last Border: Two Families and the Story of Refuge in America Summary.

<p>Summary : When Souad was seventeen she fell in love. In her village, as in so many others, sex before marriage was considered a grave dishonour to one&#8217;s family and was punishable by death. This was her crime. Her brother-in-law was given the task of arranging her punishment. One morning while Souad was washing the family&#8217;s clothes, he crept up on her, poured petrol over her and set her alight.In the eyes of their community he was a hero. An execution for a &#8216;crime of honour&#8217; was a respectable duty unlikely to bring about condemnation from others. It certainly would not have provoked calls for his prosecution. More than five thousand cases of such honour killings are reported around the world each year and many more take place that we hear nothing about.Miraculously, Souad survived rescued by the women of her village, who put out the flames and took her to a local hospital. Horrifically burned, and abandoned by her family and community, it was only the intervention of a European aid worker that </p>

<p>Summary : One night. No one will know. That was the deal. Every year, Livvy Kane and Nicholas Chandler would share one perfect night of illicit pleasure. The forbidden hours let them forget the tragedy that haunted their pasts?and the last names that made them enemies. Until the night she didn?t show up. Now Nicholas has an empire to run. He doesn?t have time for distractions and Livvy?s sudden reappearance in town is a major distraction. She?s the one woman he shouldn?t want . . . so why can?t he forget how right she feels in his bed? Livvy didn?t come home for Nicholas, but fate seems determined to remind her of his presence?and their past. Although the passion between them might have once run hot and deep, not even love can overcome the scandal that divided their families. Being together might be against all the rules . . . but being apart is impossible. </p>

<p>Summary : Hot on the heels of the New York Times bestsellers The Twin and The Lake, another pulse-pounding read from the undisputed queen of YA thrillers! They said goodbye to their friends and family for the weekend. They weren?t counting on forever.Jagged Island: a private amusement park for the very rich?or the very influential. Liam, James, Will, Ava, Harper, and Paisley?social media influencers with millions of followers?have been invited for an exclusive weekend before the park opens. They?ll make posts and videos for their channels and report every second of their VIP treatment.  When the teens arrive, they&#8217;re stunned: the resort is even better than they?d imagined. Their hotel rooms are unreal, the park?s themed rides are incredible, and the island is hauntingly beautiful. They?re given a jam-packed itinerary for the weekend.  But soon they&#8217;ll discover that something&#8217;s missing from their schedule: getting off the island alive.</p>

<p>Summary : In this thrilling new novel for fans of Megan Miranda, a wife finds herself racing for answers when the decision to rent out her family vacation home takes a deadly turn.  Newlyweds Lina and Cain don&#8217;t make it out to their vacation home on gorgeous Lake Tarawera as often as they&#8217;d like, so when Cain suggests they rent the property out on weekends, Lina reluctantly agrees.

And at first,?Lina is amazed at how quickly guests line up to spend a weekend&#8211;and at how much they&#8217;re willing to pay.? But both Lina and Cain have been keeping secrets, secrets that won&#8217;t be kept out by a new alarm system or a locked cupboard. When strange things begin happening on their property, and a visit takes a deadly turn, Lina becomes convinced that someone out there knows something they shouldn&#8217;t&#8211;and that when they come </p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;Houellebecq captures precisely the cynical disillusionment of disaffected youth.&#8221;?Booklist&#8221;This boy needs serious therapy. He may be beyond help.&#8221;?The Washington PostJust thirty, with a well-paid job, depression and no love life, the narrator and anti-hero par excellence of this grim, funny, and clever novel smokes four packs of cigarettes a day and writes weird animal stories in his spare time.A painfully realistic portrayal of the vanishing freedom of a world governed by science and by the empty rituals of daily life.Michel Houellebecq is a multi-award-winning French author. He currently lives in Spain.</p>

From a military base in Seattle to a luxury bunker, from an anarchist commune in Salt Lake City to a roaming cult that&#8217;s all too ready to see Miles as the answer to their prayers, the two race to stay ahead at every step . . . even as Billie and her sinister crew draw closer.A sharply feminist, high-stakes thriller from award-winning author Lauren Beukes, </p>

<p>Summary : An alternative cover edition for this ISBN can be found here.Suffering, failure, sin, illness, loneliness, disappointment.They all come in a seemingly endless variety of shapes and sizes. At times there seems to be no way to turn, either backwards or forwards; there is no light at either end of the tunnel. For many people such experiences raise the Why has this happened to me? Has God abandoned me? Can nobody help? Is despair all that is left to me?Large numbers of people today share such experiences and privately ask these very questions. But there is an answer. In fact there is a whole series of answers. Deserted by God? begins with the question &#8216;Can Anyone Help Me?&#8217; and draws on the experience of the psalmists in the Old Testament to help us to being to understand the ways of God. It shows how others have walked the same pathway before us. They provide us with wisdom which will lead us to the conviction of the closing chapter that we are &#8216;Never Deserted&#8217;.</p>

<p>Summary : The newest reality show hit has the unlikeliest celebrity of all in this new black and white miniseries from writer/artist Sean Murphy (JOE THE BARBARIAN, Off Road)! J2, the TV series starring a clone of Jesus Christ, causes chaos across a near-future United States in PUNK ROCK JESUS, a new miniseries written and drawn by Sean Murphy, the acclaimed illustrator of JOE THE BARBARIAN and AMERICAN VAMPIRE: SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST. J2 causes outrage and adulation. Religious zealots either love or hate the show, angry politicians worry about its influence on the nation, and members of the scientific community fear the implications of cloning a human being at all ? let alone the Son of God. And what effect will this all have on Gwen, the young woman who is selected, through an American Idol-style process, to be the mother of the new Messiah? All this leads to the hiring of Thomas McKael, the clone?s bodyguard and a former IRA operative with a turbulent past who must protect the new Messiah </p>

<p>Summary : Gillian Flynn?s Edgar Award-winning homage to the classic ghost story, published for the first time as a standalone.A canny young woman is struggling to survive by perpetrating various levels of mostly harmless fraud. On a rainy April morning, she is reading auras at Spiritual Palms when Susan Burke walks in. A keen observer of human behavior, our unnamed narrator immediately diagnoses beautiful, rich Susan as an unhappy woman eager to give her lovely life a drama injection. However, when the psychic visits the eerie Victorian home that has been the source of Susan?s terror and grief, she realizes she may not have to pretend to believe in ghosts anymore. Miles, Susan?s teenage stepson, doesn?t help matters with his disturbing manner and grisly imagination. The three are soon locked in a chilling battle to discover where the evil truly lurks and what, if anything, can be done to escape it. ?The Grownup,? which originally appeared as ?What Do You Do?? in George R. R. Martin?s Rogues </p>

<p>Summary : In Whispering Death, Mark Johnston, one of Australia&#8217;s leading experts on World War II, explains vividly how more than 130,000 Australian airmen fought Japan from the Pacific War&#8217;s first hours in 1941 to its last in 1945. They clashed over a vast area, from India to Noumea, Bass Strait to the Philippines. Merely flying over that region&#8217;s boundless oceans and wild weather was dangerous enough for Australia&#8217;s fliers, but their formidable enemies made it much more perilous. In their Zero fighters and Betty bombers they were initially too numerous, experienced and well-armed for the few Australians who opposed them in Malaya, the Northern Territory,?and New Guinea.

But in the months following, Australian aircrew won or contributed to great aerial victories in the air over Port Moresby, Milne Bay, the Papuan beachheads and the Bismarck Sea. The American air force grew to </p>

<p>Summary : Bestselling authors David and Leigh Eddings welcome readers back to the time before The Belgariad and The Malloreon series. Join them as they chronicle that fateful conflict between two mortally opposed Destinies, in a monumental war of men and kings and Gods.When the world was young and Gods still walked among their mortal children, a headstrong orphan boy set out to explore the world. Thus began the extraordinary adventures that would mold that youthful vagabond into a man, and the man into the finely honed instrument of Prophecy known to all the world as Belgarath the Sorcerer.Then came the dark day when the Dark God Torak split the world asunder, and the God Aldur and his disciples began their monumental labor to set Destiny aright. Foremost among their number was Belgarath. His ceaseless devotion was foredoomed to cost him that which he held most dear&#8211;even as his loyal service would extend through echoing centuries of loss, of struggle, and of ultimate triumph.</p>

<p>Summary : In this fascinating collection of dark medical history, curious cures, and modern medical interventions, pathologists&#8217; assistant A.D. Gray examines infectious diseases in a quirky, yet oddly compelling manner. The excessively graphic, borderline ridiculous portraits of microscopic monsters and discussions of dark medical history will simultaneously educate and entertain in a way that neutralizes some of the terror illness can create. You&#8217;ll gain a basic understanding of how diseases operate and what to do about them, plus you&#8217;ll learn that history often repeats itself during global pandemics.Packed with fun facts that might make you squirm, Compendium Pandemica: A Guide to Horrible Infectious Diseases is a must-have for fans of disgusting medical shows, bodily horrors, and anyone with an interest in medical history or the microscopic world around them</p>

You&amp;#8217;ll gain a basic understanding of how diseases operate and what to do about them, plus you&amp;#8217;ll learn that history often repeats itself during global pandemics.Packed with fun facts that might make you squirm, Compendium Pandemica: A Guide to Horrible Infectious Diseases is a must-have for fans of disgusting medical shows, bodily horrors, and anyone with an interest in medical history or the microscopic world around them Discover the Bestseller Everyone is Talking About: Read Compendium Pandemica: A Guide to Horrible Infectious Diseases PDF , Reading Compendium Pandemica: A Guide to Horrible Infectious Diseases pdf , Compendium Pandemica: A Guide to Horrible Infectious Diseases Handbook , Compendium Pandemica: A Guide to Horrible Infectious Diseases read , Compendium Pandemica: A Guide to Horrible Infectious Diseases epub , Compendium Pandemica: A Guide to Horrible Infectious Diseases in English , Compendium Pandemica: A Guide to Horrible Infectious Diseases Kindle , Compendium Pandemica: A Guide to Horrible Infectious Diseases audiobook Compendium Pandemica: A Guide to Horrible Infectious Diseases Summary.

<p>Summary : A finales de 1888, un nuevo tipo de criminal surgi? entre las sombr?as e insalubres calles de Whitechapel en Londres. Un asesino capaz de atacar en plena calle a sus v?ctimas y escapar, una y otra vez, ante la mirada impotente de las autoridades. Apodado Jack el Destripador, el mito alrededor de su figura no ha hecho m?s que acrecentarse desde entonces, convirti?ndolo en un aut?ntico icono cultural. Pero, ?qui?n era realmente Jack el Destripador?Innumerables investigaciones han intentado desentra?ar este misterio, con m?s o menos fortuna, desde el mismo d?a en que se produjeron los cr?menes. Sin embargo, la verdadera identidad de Jack el Destripador sigue escapando entre las sombras m?s de un siglo despu?s.Ahora, el escritor Juan Carlos Bo?za se adentra en una novedosa investigaci?n, libre de prejuicios y completamente distinta a las realizadas hasta ahora. Volviendo a los archivos policiales originales, examinando declaraciones de testigos y pruebas reales, los hechos son expuestos </p>

<p>Summary : Entomologist Justin O. Schmidt is on a mission. Some say it&#8217;s a brave exploration, others shake their heads in disbelief. His goal? To compare the impacts of stinging insects on humans, mainly using himself as the gauge.In The Sting of the Wild, the colorful Dr. Schmidt takes us on a journey inside the lives of stinging insects, seeing the world through their eyes as well as his own. He explains how and why they attack and reveals the powerful punch they can deliver with a small venom gland and a &#8220;sting,&#8221; the name for the apparatus that delivers the venom. We learn which insects are the worst to encounter and why some are barely worth considering.The Sting of the Wild includes the complete Schmidt Sting Pain Index, published here for the first time. In addition to a numerical ranking of the agony of each of the eighty-three stings he&#8217;s sampled so far (from below 1 to an excruciatingly painful 4), Schmidt describes them in prose worthy of a professional wine critic: &#8220;Looks deceive. </p>

<p>Summary : In a darkened room a young man sits telling the macabre and eerie story of his life &#8211; the story of a vampire, gifted with eternal life, cursed with an exquisite craving for human blood. Anne Rice&#8217;s compulsively readable novel is arguably the most celebrated work of vampire fiction since Bram Stoker&#8217;s Dracula was published in 1897. As the Washington Post said on its first publication, it is a &#8216;thrilling, strikingly original work of the imagination . . . sometimes horrible, sometimes beautiful, always unforgettable&#8217;. 14 hrs and 24 mins</p>
