<p>Summary : After years of lusting over Jake Wolfe, Nicole finally got a taste of the dirty-talking bad boy. During the scenting ceremony, he showed her how explosive things can be between them. But Nicole doesn?t do love. She doesn?t even know what love is. So how can she know if a relationship with Jake would be the right path to take?  Jake Wolfe wants Nic more than his next breath. She?s curvy, mouthy and so hot his blood boils just thinking of her. But Nic?s been keeping him at a distance. And Jake is tired of her games. One fateful trip to Sin City and all bets are off.  After a fun night of drinking, Nic wakes up married to Jake and with a second shifter wanting her for himself. She&#8217;ll have to finally face the feelings she has or shut them out forever. Their newly formed bond will either allow her to open her heart to love or leave Jake without a mate to call his own.  Warning: If you don&#8217;t like sex of any kind, this is probably not the book for you. There&#8217;s graphic language (yes, he </p>

<p>Summary : In The Tivoli Road Baker , British-born pastry chef Michael James and his team share the knowledge that goes into creating standout bread and pastries. The mission is to make these recipes accessible for people who are new to the art while also including tips, ideas and inspiration to challenge more skilled cooks and bakers.Chapters cover basic to advanced bread making techniques, sweet pastries, savory favorites as well as a handful of British recipes close to Michael&#8217;s heart, including Cornish pasties. The reader will also learn about the importance of starting with quality produce, offering a small window on the valuable (but mostly unsung role) played by farmers in the growing global appetite for real bread. This is a beautiful book that shares some of the X-factor that makes its namesake so successful.</p>

<p>Summary : In The Tivoli Road Baker , British-born pastry chef Michael James and his team share the knowledge that goes into creating standout bread and pastries. The mission is to make these recipes accessible for people who are new to the art while also including tips, ideas and inspiration to challenge more skilled cooks and bakers.Chapters cover basic to advanced bread making techniques, sweet pastries, savory favorites as well as a handful of British recipes close to Michael&#8217;s heart, including Cornish pasties. The reader will also learn about the importance of starting with quality produce, offering a small window on the valuable (but mostly unsung role) played by farmers in the growing global appetite for real bread. This is a beautiful book that shares some of the X-factor that makes its namesake so successful.</p>

<p>Summary : The Commentary on the Gospel According to St. Matthew is a translation of Saint Thomas Aquinas&#8217; lectures on the Gospel of Saint Matthew given in Paris in approximately the year 1270. This is the first ever translation into English of this major work of the Angelic Doctor. It will be a useful commentary for Catholics and non-Catholics, but especially as an aid for preaching sermons. Numerous explanations and cross references to other works of St. Thomas are given in the text. St. Thomas is a master of Scripture and the Church Fathers, which are continuously interwoven in this simple but profoundly enlightening text.</p>

<p>Summary : &#8216;We are each our own devil, and we make this world our hell.&#8217;It&#8217;s been seventeen months since the Bloodsmith butchered his first victim and Operation Maypole is still no nearer to catching him. The media is whipping up a storm, the top brass are demanding results, but the investigation is sinking fast.Now isn&#8217;t the time to get distracted with other cases, but Detective Sergeant Lucy McVeigh doesn&#8217;t have much choice. When Benedict Strachan was just eleven, he hunted down and killed a homeless man. No one&#8217;s ever figured out why Benedict did it, but now, after sixteen years, he&#8217;s back on the streets again &#8211; battered, frightened, convinced a shadowy &#8216;They&#8217; are out to get him, and begging Lucy for help.It sounds like paranoia, but what if he&#8217;s right? What if he really is caught up in something bigger and darker than Lucy&#8217;s ever dealt with before? What if the Bloodsmith isn&#8217;t the only monster out there?

<p>Summary : &#8216;We are each our own devil, and we make this world our hell.&#8217;It&#8217;s been seventeen months since the Bloodsmith butchered his first victim and Operation Maypole is still no nearer to catching him. The media is whipping up a storm, the top brass are demanding results, but the investigation is sinking fast.Now isn&#8217;t the time to get distracted with other cases, but Detective Sergeant Lucy McVeigh doesn&#8217;t have much choice. When Benedict Strachan was just eleven, he hunted down and killed a homeless man. No one&#8217;s ever figured out why Benedict did it, but now, after sixteen years, he&#8217;s back on the streets again &#8211; battered, frightened, convinced a shadowy &#8216;They&#8217; are out to get him, and begging Lucy for help.It sounds like paranoia, but what if he&#8217;s right? What if he really is caught up in something bigger and darker than Lucy&#8217;s ever dealt with before? What if the Bloodsmith isn&#8217;t the only monster out there? And what&#8217;s going to happen when Lucy goes after them?</p>

<p>Summary : The evidence is irrefutable: In sixteen New York Times bestsellers over the course of as many years, Kathy Reichs has proven herself ?a genius at building suspense? (New York Daily News). In forensic anthropologist Temperance Brennan, Reichs has created a detective fiction heroine who?s brilliant to the bone. ?Every minute in the morgue with Tempe is golden,? says The New York Times Book Review. In the acclaimed author?s thrilling new novel, Brennan is at the top of her game in a battle of wits against the most monstrous adversary she has ever encountered.Unexpectedly called in to the Charlotte PD?s Cold Case Unit, Dr. Temperance Brennan wonders why she?s been asked to meet with a homicide cop who?s a long way from his own jurisdiction. The shocking answer: Two child murders, separated by thousands of miles, have one thing in common &#8212; the killer. Years ago, Anique Pomerleau kidnapped and murdered a string of girls in Canada, then narrowly eluded capture. It was a devastating defeat </p>

<p>Summary : Championing the liberatory potential of silence to address the fraught disability politics of queerness In queer culture, silence has been equated with voicelessness, complicity, and even death. Queer Silence insists, however, that silence can be a generative and empowering mode of survival. Triangulating insights from queer studies, disability studies, and rhetorical studies, J. Logan Smilges explores what silence can mean for people whose bodyminds signify more powerfully than their words.Queer Silence begins by historicizing silence?s negative reputation, beginning with the ways homophile activists rejected medical models pathologizing homosexuality as a disability, resulting in the silencing of disability itself.

<p>Summary : Championing the liberatory potential of silence to address the fraught disability politics of queerness In queer culture, silence has been equated with voicelessness, complicity, and even death. Queer Silence insists, however, that silence can be a generative and empowering mode of survival. Triangulating insights from queer studies, disability studies, and rhetorical studies, J. Logan Smilges explores what silence can mean for people whose bodyminds signify more powerfully than their words.Queer Silence begins by historicizing silence?s negative reputation, beginning with the ways homophile activists rejected medical models pathologizing homosexuality as a disability, resulting in the silencing of disability itself. This silencing was redoubled by HIV/AIDS activism?s demand for ?out, loud, and proud? rhetorical activities that saw silence as capitulation.Reading a range of cultural artifacts whose relative silence has failed to attract queer attachment, from anonymous profiles on </p>

<p>Summary : Master mythologist Martin Shaw uses timeless story-wisdom to examine our broken relationship with the world.There is an old legend that says we each have a wild, curious twin that was thrown out the window the night we were born, taking much of our vitality with them. If there was something we were meant to do with our few, brief years on Earth, we can be sure that the wild twin is holding the key.In Courting the Wild Twin, Dr. Martin Shaw invites us to seek out our wild twin??a metaphor for the part of ourselves that we generally shun or ignore to conform to societal norms??to invite them back into our consciousness, for they have something important to tell us. He challenges us to examine our broken relationship with the world, to think boldly, wildly, and in new ways about ourselves?as individuals and as a collective.Through the use of scholarship, storytelling, and personal reflection, Shaw unpacks two ancient European fairy tales that concern the mysterious wild twin.

<p>Summary : GUARDIAN BOOKS OF THE YEAR 2014No marriage of a major twentieth-century writer lasted longer than Vladimir Nabokov&#8217;s. V?ra Slonim shared his delight at the enchantment of life&#8217;s trifles and literature&#8217;s treasures, and he rated her as having the best and quickest sense of humour of any woman he had met. From their meeting in 1921, Vladimir&#8217;s letters to his beloved V?ra form a narrative arc that tells a forty-six year-long love story, and they are memorable in their entirety. Almost always playful, romantic, and pithy, the letters tell us much about the man and the writer; we see that Vladimir observed everything, from animals, faces, speech, and landscapes with genuine fascination.</p>

<p>Summary : GUARDIAN BOOKS OF THE YEAR 2014No marriage of a major twentieth-century writer lasted longer than Vladimir Nabokov&#8217;s. V?ra Slonim shared his delight at the enchantment of life&#8217;s trifles and literature&#8217;s treasures, and he rated her as having the best and quickest sense of humour of any woman he had met. From their meeting in 1921, Vladimir&#8217;s letters to his beloved V?ra form a narrative arc that tells a forty-six year-long love story, and they are memorable in their entirety. Almost always playful, romantic, and pithy, the letters tell us much about the man and the writer; we see that Vladimir observed everything, from animals, faces, speech, and landscapes with genuine fascination.</p>

<p>Summary : The story of a girl who lost her mind &#8211; and found it. A brilliant and uncompromising picture of life in a mental hospital.Virginia Cunningham had moved with her husband from the security of a mid-western town to New York City. She had worked and played too hard and worried too much. One day she simply blacked out, and for months afterwards was only at intervals conscious of who and where she was. It is these periods of comparative sanity that she recalls in this book; periods which gradually grew more frequent, until at last she was discharged as cured.There were times when the iron discipline, the dreaded &#8216;tubs&#8217; and shock therapy, the antics of the inmates (including herself), and the other horrors of a nightmare world were almost beyond endurance. And there were times when Juniper Hill was a blessed refuge from a life too complex for a sick mind to face.&#8221;The Snake Pit&#8221; might have been a horror story, but it is told with such warmth and sympathy and touches of humour, that the </p>

<p>Summary : When Rose tagged along with her big sister to a baby shower the last thing she expected was to meet a guy. But this wasn?t just any guy. This was the exciting, sexy as sin, way out of her league black sheep of his family&#8211;Vincent Moreno. Even more surprising, this heart-stopping bad boy seemed interested in her. Fate always had a way of interfering in Vince?s best-laid plans. His forced attendance to his annoyingly perfect cousin?s baby shower was no different. He was sure to be bored out of his skull, but instead, he met sweet little Rosie Zendejas.  What begins as a unlikely friendship between two very different people turns into one of the most intense and passionate relationships that neither ever saw coming. But just like it had so many times in Vince?s troubled past, Fate steps in once again, threatening to take away the one thing he can?t seem to even breathe without now?Rose. Mature YA &#8211; New Adult. Fate is a Moreno Brothers spinoff series. All books in the series are stand </p>

<p>Summary : This season, I&#8217;ve got a lot to prove&#8230;Terry King may have been born into kitesurfing royalty, but he&#8217;s been overlooked and overshadowed his entire life. Unlike his fame-starved father, Trenton &#8216;King of the Air&#8217; King, or his two attention-grabbing older brothers, Terry doesn&#8217;t compete for fame, money, or power. He&#8217;s got much more ambitious goals than that.Terry has his sights set on reuniting his dysfunctional family and finally landing his forever crush: Richie Brown. A six-foot-four, anxiety-riddled, ginger teddy bear who writes heart-melting poetry. Also, the one and only person who&#8217;s ever truly seen Terry.Richie grew up next door to the King brothers in the sleepy coastal town of Airlie Beach, Australia. His childhood was marred by a tragedy that continues to invade every corner of his life twenty years later. Richie gave up on love a long time ago&#8230;until something unexpected happened the night of Terry&#8217;s victory last season.Richie knows better than anyone why Terry King is </p>

<p>Summary : This season, I&#8217;ve got a lot to prove&#8230;Terry King may have been born into kitesurfing royalty, but he&#8217;s been overlooked and overshadowed his entire life. Unlike his fame-starved father, Trenton &#8216;King of the Air&#8217; King, or his two attention-grabbing older brothers, Terry doesn&#8217;t compete for fame, money, or power. He&#8217;s got much more ambitious goals than that.Terry has his sights set on reuniting his dysfunctional family and finally landing his forever crush: Richie Brown. A six-foot-four, anxiety-riddled, ginger teddy bear who writes heart-melting poetry. Also, the one and only person who&#8217;s ever truly seen Terry.Richie grew up next door to the King brothers in the sleepy coastal town of Airlie Beach, Australia. His childhood was marred by a tragedy that continues to invade every corner of his life twenty years later. Richie gave up on love a long time ago&#8230;until something unexpected happened the night of Terry&#8217;s victory last season.Richie knows better than anyone why Terry King is </p>

<p>Summary : Monica is a series of interconnected narratives that collectively tell the life story ? actually, stories ? of its title character. Clowes calls upon a lifetime of inspiration to create the most complex and personal graphic novel of his distinguished career. Rich with visual detail, an impeccable ear for language and dialogue, and thrilling twists, Monica is a multilayered masterpiece in comics form that alludes to many of the genres that have defined the medium ? war, romance, horror, crime, the supernatural, etc. ? but in a mysterious, uncategorizable, and quintessentially Clowesian way that rewards multiple readings.Five years in the making, Monica marks the apex of creativity from one of the defining voices of the graphic novel boom over the past quarter-century. A new book from Clowes is always a huge event in comics and literary circles; Monica will be the biggest literary event of 2023.</p>

All 78 cards feature an exquisite level of detail that highlights the powerful symbolism.The 70-page instruction booklet includes an introduction by Stuart R. Kaplan and card meaning written by Godfrey Dowson and Stuart R. Kaplan.

Perfect for fans of Sadie and Dear Martin. Safiya Mirza dreams of becoming a journalist. And one thing she?s learned as editor of her school newspaper is that a journalist?s job is to find the facts and not let personal biases affect the story. But all that changes the day she finds the body of a murdered boy.Jawad Ali was fourteen years old when he built a cosplay jetpack that a teacher mistook for a bomb. A jetpack that got him arrested, labeled a terrorist?and eventually killed. But he?s more than a dead body, and more than ?Bomb Boy.? He was a person with a life worth remembering.Driven by Jawad?s haunting voice guiding her throughout her investigation, Safiya seeks to tell the whole truth about the murdered boy and those who killed him because of their hate-based beliefs.

<p>Summary : Sotto il vessillo della Guerra santa, grazie alla guida di Berlino e alla longa manus di Costantinopoli, tedeschi e turchi diedero il via nel 1914, mentre la Prima guerra mondiale si preparava a devastare il Vecchio continente, al tentativo di scatenare la rivoluzione nell?India britannica e nell?Asia centrale russa, nonch? di rafforzarsi in Medio Oriente.

Raccontato con epici dettagli, Servizi segreti a Oriente di Costantinopoli ? il resoconto delle imprese, dei complotti, dei fallimenti e dei successi delle spie, dei cospiratori, dei diplomatici e degli avventurieri che vi presero parte nei due opposti schieramenti, in un susseguirsi di eroismi, tradimenti e sacri?ci.</p>

<p>Summary : A timely essay collection on the development and influence of secular expressions of Buddhism in the West and beyond.How do secular values impact Buddhism in the modern world? What versions of Buddhism are being transmitted to the West? Is it possible to know whether an interpretation of the Buddha?s words is correct? In this new essay collection, opposing ideas that often define Buddhist communities?secular versus religious, modern versus traditional, Western versus Eastern?are unpacked and critically examined. These reflections by contemporary scholars and practitioners reveal the dynamic process of reinterpreting and reimagining Buddhism in secular contexts, from the mindfulness movement to Buddhist shrine displays in museums, to whether rebirth is an essential belief. This collection explores a wide range of modern understandings of Buddhism?whether it is considered a religion, philosophy, or lifestyle choice?and questions if secular Buddhism is purely a Western invention, </p>

<p>Summary : *Running Time =&gt; 1 hr.*A rediscovered classic and international best-seller that recounts the gripping tale of a friendship destroyed at the hands of Nazi Germany.In this searing novel, Katherine Kressmann Taylor brings vividly to life the insidious spread of Nazism through a series of letters between Max, a Jewish art dealer in San Francisco, and Martin, his friend and business business partner who has returned to Germany in 1932.Originally published in &#8216;Story&#8217; magazine in 1938, &#8216;ADDRESS UNKNOWN&#8217; became an international sensation. Credited with exposing the dangers of Nazism to American learners early on, it is also a scathing indictment of fascist movements around the world and a harrowing expos? of the power of the pen as a weapon.A powerful and eloquent tale about the consequences of a friendship &#8211; and society &#8211; poisoned by extremism, &#8216;ADDRESS UNKNOWN&#8217; remains hauntingly and painfully relevant today.?1938 Katherine Kressmann Taylor (P)2021 HarperCollins Publishers</p>

<p>Summary : Caught in a struggle to navigate the often-conflicting demands of faith, career, and relationships, Elizza BenTaleb is a young Muslim woman in her final semester obtaining MBA. While dreaming to open up a clean energy business to help people in Libya on the one hand, she is trying to mother her four sisters, each divergent in their own ways &#8211; from uber-conservative to Insta-famous Hijabi &#8211; on the other. Elizza&#8217;s life takes a complicated turn when a successful Libyan businessman, Firas Tarseen, is hired for a semester to give lectures at the university. Elizza has some less than genial encounters with the fellow, but can&#8217;t seem to avoid bumping into him everywhere. Can they overlook their first impressions of each other to realize that they may have more in common than they know?</p>

<p>Summary : What separates a marriage from any other romance? These days, it can be hard to tell: modern marriages are too often 100% emotional relationships that are abandoned whenever feelings flare up or run dry. In Don&#8217;t Divorce, clinical psychologist Dr. Diane Medved uses her decades of field experience to show couples how to fortify their marriages with logical reasoning. Emotion trumps logic in marital decision-making, Dr. Medved says; and she has the divorce case studies to prove it. But it doesn&#8217;t have to be that way?and your marriage certainly doesn&#8217;t have to end that way. Don&#8217;t Divorce will help you find and strengthen the logical underpinning of your marriage so that there&#8217;s more than emotions standing between you and divorce.</p>

<p>Summary : In the history of philosophy, few topics are so relevant to today&#8217;s cultural and political landscape as philosophy in the Islamic world. Yet, this remains one of the lesser-known philosophical traditions.

<p>Summary : Melville Heights is one of the nicest neighbourhoods in Bristol, England; home to doctors and lawyers and old-money academics. It?s not the sort of place where people are brutally murdered in their own kitchens. But it is the sort of place where everyone has a secret. And everyone is watching you.As the headmaster credited with turning around the local school, Tom Fitzwilliam is beloved by one and all?including Joey Mullen, his new neighbor, who quickly develops an intense infatuation with this thoroughly charming yet unavailable man. Joey thinks her crush is a secret, but Tom?s teenaged son Freddie?a prodigy with aspirations of becoming a spy for MI5?excels in observing people and has witnessed Joey behaving strangely around his father.One of Tom?s students, Jenna Tripp, also lives on the same street, and she?s not convinced her teacher is as squeaky clean as he seems.

<p>Summary : The man with allergies never gets the girl, at least according to the movies?and Portland restaurateur Ian Zamora wants to be the guy who gets the girl. So to rid himself of the sensitivities brought on by his sometimes-girlfriend?s cat, he makes an appointment with allergist Petra Lale. But he suddenly finds himself acutely attracted to the very woman who is supposed to be helping him take care of his problem. Petra?s intrigued by Ian?s quiet strength and sexy body, but her solo practice is new and struggling. She can?t afford to compromise her ethics?or risk her medical license?by dating a patient. Falling in love certainly wasn?t this doctor?s order. She tries to stay away from Ian, but fate, and her weak willpower, keep bringing them back together.  Do two career-driven people with inexperienced hearts stand a chance of finding the right prescription for love?</p>

<p>Summary : Insanity is falling for your best friend, especially when you?re straight.Igor is ready to retire his goalie pads and move on to coaching, but first he needs to get through hip surgery. Waking up, he&#8217;s shocked to find his best friend sitting in the room. Yuri should be in Russia visiting family, not insisting on helping Igor with his recovery.Yuri is known for his patience in net. Calculated and calm, he?s everything Igor is not, and exactly what Igor needs after surgery. Leaving Igor to recover alone was never an option, and his insistence on pushing limits only proves Yuri was right.The more time they spend together, the more the lines of friendship get blurred. Igor might not be as straight as he?s always thought. Except Yuri doesn?t need a boyfriend, he?s looking for a submissive. Not just any will do. He wants one who pushes boundaries and Yuri&#8217;s patience. Just because Igor can drive him insane doesn?t mean he?s the brat Yuri?s been looking for? or maybe it does.</p>

<p>Summary : A vibrant and uplifting collection of comic illustrations about LGBTQ+ life, for the community and beyond, from the creator of the online sensation @queeeerchameleon that&#8217;s loved by millions.Queer Chameleon and Friends reminds us that all experiences are valid, empowers us to accept and express our identities and those of others, and reassures us that even in challenging moments along the way, there?s light and humour to be found.In this colourful, insightful and funny book, writer and illustrator Amee Wilson explores aspects of existing in a world not always designed for you ? from silly questions and awkward-but-sometimes-accurate clich?s, to the trials and tribulations of coming out (or choosing not to).A collection of beautifully illustrated conversations between the beloved character Queer Chameleon and their friends from across the community, it?s a joyous celebration of life outside the boxes modern society has created.</p>

Apa saja yang ingin kamu lakukan, bisa di sana, dan apa saja yang ingin kamu punya, ada di sana.?Roanne van Voorst, seorang antropolog yang meneliti tentang respons manusia terhadap banjir, memutuskan mengikuti anak muda itu dan tiba di salah satu kampung kumuh termiskin di Jakarta. Dia menetap di sana lebih dari setahun, di sebuah rumah dari papan dan asbes. Semakin lama dia semakin mengenal tetangganya dan keadaan hidup mereka: kemelaratan luar biasa, ancaman penggusuran karena pemukiman itu ilegal, dan terutama pergulatan mereka dengan banjir dari sungai yang sangat tercemar. Dalam menghadapi masalah-masalah tersebut, penghuni pemukiman kumuh ini menemukan cara-cara yang efisien, kerap inovatif dan kreatif, yang mereka ajarkan kepada ?anak angkat? mereka yang baru.

<p>Summary : A summer in Greece for three best friends ends in the unthinkable when only two return home in this new novel from Ella Berman. . . .Ten years ago, after a sun-soaked summer spent in Greece, best friends Bess and Joni were cleared of having any involvement in their friend Evangeline?s death. But that didn?t stop the media from ripping apart their teenage lives like vultures.While the girls were never convicted, Joni, ever the opportunist, capitalized on her newfound infamy to become a motivational speaker. Bess, on the other hand, resolved to make her life as small and controlled as possible so she wouldn?t risk losing everything all over again. And it almost worked. . . .Except now Joni is tangled up in a crime eerily similar to that one fateful night in Greece. And when she asks Bess to come back to LA to support her, Bess has a decision to make.Is it finally time to face up to what happened that night, exposing herself as the young woman she once was and maybe still is? And what </p>

<p>Summary : Veteran urban activist Robert Lupton reveals the shockingly toxic effects that modern charity has upon the very people meant to benefit from it. Toxic Charity provides proven new models for charitable groups who want to help?not sabotage?those whom they desire to serve. Lupton, the founder of FCS Urban Ministries (Focused Community Strategies) in Atlanta, the voice of the Urban Perspectives newsletter, and the author of Compassion, Justice and the Christian Life, has been at the forefront of urban ministry activism for forty years. Now, in the vein of Jeffrey Sachs?s The End of Poverty, Richard Stearns?s The Hole in Our Gospel, and Gregory Boyle?s Tattoos on the Heart, his groundbreaking Toxic Charity shows us how to start serving needy and impoverished members of our communities in a way that will lead to lasting, real-world change.</p>

<p>Summary : Veteran urban activist Robert Lupton reveals the shockingly toxic effects that modern charity has upon the very people meant to benefit from it. Toxic Charity provides proven new models for charitable groups who want to help?not sabotage?those whom they desire to serve. Lupton, the founder of FCS Urban Ministries (Focused Community Strategies) in Atlanta, the voice of the Urban Perspectives newsletter, and the author of Compassion, Justice and the Christian Life, has been at the forefront of urban ministry activism for forty years. Now, in the vein of Jeffrey Sachs?s The End of Poverty, Richard Stearns?s The Hole in Our Gospel, and Gregory Boyle?s Tattoos on the Heart, his groundbreaking Toxic Charity shows us how to start serving needy and impoverished members of our communities in a way that will lead to lasting, real-world change.</p>

<p>Summary : Dr. Kay Scarpetta is working a highly suspicious death scene in a historic home in Cambridge, Massachusetts when an emergency alert sounds on her phone. A video link lands in her text messages, immediately begins playing&#8230; and seems to be from her niece Lucy. But how can it be? It?s clearly a surveillance film of Lucy taken almost twenty years ago.As Scarpetta watches she comes to grips with frightening secrets about her niece, whom she loves like a daughter. That first clip and others sent soon after raise dangerous implications that increasingly isolate Scarpetta and leave her confused, alarmed, and not knowing where to turn. She doesn?t know whom she can tell ? not her FBI agent husband, Benton Wesley, or her investigative partner, Pete Marino. Not even Lucy.Cornwell launches these unforgettable characters on an intensely psychological odyssey that includes the bizarre death of a Hollywood mogul?s daughter, wreckage on the bottom of the sea in the Bermuda Triangle, a grisly gift </p>

<p>Summary : The Defensive Value Investor is a complete step-by-step guide to building a high-yield, low-risk share portfolio. Defensive investing focuses on strong, steady companies that produce decent rates of income and capital growth, but with risk often coming from a lofty share price. Value investing on the other hand is focused on buying companies on the cheap, but cheap companies often deserve to be cheap because they are high risk and unlikely to grow. Defensive Value combines the two and involves buying relatively defensive companies at value for money prices. John Kingham explains how to screen for shares with the best combination of quality, value, income and growth, how to conduct a thorough qualitative analysis, when to buy, when to sell, and how to combine your investments into an easy to manage portfolio which reduces risk and increases returns. He also illustrates the method throughout with the help of real-life examples. Each step of the process has a simple &#8220;rule of thumb&#8221; to </p>

<p>Summary : This might be the most decisive book you can find in terms of defining your relationship with your partner, children, parents, siblings and close friends. Jesper Juul reveals with great insight why it is only possible to say &#8220;Yes!&#8221; to yourself when you also feel liberated and free to say &#8220;No!&#8221; to others. By letting go of the obligation to be nice and the need to serve and please others, it is easier to connect with your true identity. Jesper Juul reveals the secret to developing and maintaining a healthy mind, social competence as well as staying true to yourself. When reading this practical book you will discover why &#8220;No!&#8221; is also called &#8220;the most loving answer&#8221; and therefore is the ultimate gift to yourself and those you hold near and dear.</p>

Jesper Juul reveals with great insight why it is only possible to say &#8220;Yes!&#8221; to yourself when you also feel liberated and free to say &#8220;No!&#8221; to others. By letting go of the obligation to be nice and the need to serve and please others, it is easier to connect with your true identity. Jesper Juul reveals the secret to developing and maintaining a healthy mind, social competence as well as staying true to yourself. When reading this practical book you will discover why &#8220;No!&#8221; is also called &#8220;the most loving answer&#8221; and therefore is the ultimate gift to yourself and those you hold near and dear.</p>

  Do you believe in hate at first sight? <br />
DixonIf I had to choose one word to describe my new cocky costar, it?d be exasperating. Nikolas Adamos may look like a Greek god?and he certainly struts around like he knows it?but unlike everyone else, I refuse to fall prey to his charms.Unfortunately for me, Niko and I get paired to do a series of lovey-dovey boyfriend videos for our employers at Elite 8 Studios. And when you film the sort of scenes we do, up close and personal takes on a whole new meaning.I may have to play nice while the cameras are rolling, but off set, it?s another matter entirely. So what if our chemistry is off the charts? That doesn?t mean a thing. Nor does the tender look in Niko?s eye when we?re together under the lights.Because I know the truth. Nikolas Adamos revels in riling me up. And even though my pesky friends think I need fireworks after a string of fizzled relationships, I have no doubt if I allow myself to get any closer to my new fake boyfriend, I?ll </p>

<p>Summary : Fuelled by a powerful curiosity and the need to see, feel and hear firsthand and close-up, Michael Crichton experienced adventures as compelling as those he created in his books and films.When Crichton ? a Harvard-trained physician, bestselling novelist, and successful movie director ? began to feel isolated in his own life, he decided to widen his horizons. He tracked wild animals in the jungles of Rwanda. He climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro and Mayan pyramids. He trekked across a landslide in Pakistan. He swam amid sharks in Tahiti. This is a record of those travels ? an exhilarating quest across the familiar and exotic frontiers of the outer world, a determined odyssey into the unfathomable, spiritual depths of the inner world. It is an adventure of risk and rejuvenation, terror and wonder, as exciting as Michael Crichton?s many masterful and widely heralded works of fiction.</p>

<p>Summary : Fuelled by a powerful curiosity and the need to see, feel and hear firsthand and close-up, Michael Crichton experienced adventures as compelling as those he created in his books and films.When Crichton ? a Harvard-trained physician, bestselling novelist, and successful movie director ? began to feel isolated in his own life, he decided to widen his horizons. He tracked wild animals in the jungles of Rwanda. He climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro and Mayan pyramids. He trekked across a landslide in Pakistan. He swam amid sharks in Tahiti. This is a record of those travels ? an exhilarating quest across the familiar and exotic frontiers of the outer world, a determined odyssey into the unfathomable, spiritual depths of the inner world. It is an adventure of risk and rejuvenation, terror and wonder, as exciting as Michael Crichton?s many masterful and widely heralded works of fiction.</p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  A devil&#8217;s bargain. <br />
Desperate to escape her scheming relatives, Evangeline Jenner has sought the help of the most infamous scoundrel in London. A marriage of convenience is the only solution.No one would have ever paired the shy, stammering wallflower with the sinfully handsome viscount. It quickly becomes clear, however, that Evie is a woman of hidden strength?and Sebastian desires her more than any woman he&#8217;s ever known.Determined to win her husband&#8217;s elusive heart, Evie dares to strike a bargain with the devil: if Sebastian can stay celibate for three months, she will allow him into her bed. When Evie is threatened by a vengeful enemy from the past, Sebastian vows to do whatever it takes to protect his wife . . . even at the expense of his own life.Together they will defy their perilous fate, for the sake of all-consuming love.</p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;Jess&#8217;s work displays a deep sense of cool black consciousness, especially in regard to musicality. He works with an expressive tradition that blends sensibilities of field holler, spiritual encodings, gospel moan and groan, work song cadence, blue notes, and jook joint jazz.&#8221;?Howard Ramsby II, Sou&#8217;westerPart fact, part fiction, Tyehimba Jess&#8217;s much anticipated second book weaves sonnet, song, and narrative to examine the lives of mostly unrecorded African American performers directly before and after the Civil War up to World War I. Olio is an effort to understand how they met, resisted, complicated, co-opted, and sometimes defeated attempts to minstrelize them.So, while I lead this choir, I still find thatI&#8217;m being led?I&#8217;m a missionarymending my faith in the midst of this flock?I toil in their fields of praise. When folks seethese freedmen stand and sing, they hear their Godspeak in tongues. These nine dark mouths sing shelter;they echo a hymn&#8217;s haven from slavery&#8217;s weather.Detroit </p>

He works with an expressive tradition that blends sensibilities of field holler, spiritual encodings, gospel moan and groan, work song cadence, blue notes, and jook joint jazz.&#8221;?Howard Ramsby II, Sou&#8217;westerPart fact, part fiction, Tyehimba Jess&#8217;s much anticipated second book weaves sonnet, song, and narrative to examine the lives of mostly unrecorded African American performers directly before and after the Civil War up to World War I. Olio is an effort to understand how they met, resisted, complicated, co-opted, and sometimes defeated attempts to minstrelize them.So, while I lead this choir, I still find thatI&#8217;m being led?I&#8217;m a missionarymending my faith in the midst of this flock?I toil in their fields of praise. When folks seethese freedmen stand and sing, they hear their Godspeak in tongues. These nine dark mouths sing shelter;they echo a hymn&#8217;s haven from slavery&#8217;s weather.Detroit </p>

Why should writers follow Aristotle? Jane Alison in her fresh, original book about narrative is our new Aristotle.&amp;#8221; ?Edmund White, author of The Unpunished Vice: A Life of ReadingAs Jane Alison writes in the introduction to her insightful and appealing book about the craft of writing: &amp;#8220;For centuries there&amp;#8217;s been one path through fiction we&amp;#8217;re most likely to travel?one we&amp;#8217;re actually told to follow?and that&amp;#8217;s the dramatic arc: a situation arises, grows tense, reaches a peak, subsides&amp;#8230;But something that swells and tautens until climax, then collapses? Bit masculo-sexual, no? So many other patterns run through nature, tracing other deep motions in life. Why not draw on them, too?&amp;#8221;W. G. Sebald&amp;#8217;s Emigrants was the first novel to show Alison how forward momentum can be created by way of pattern, rather than the traditional arc?or, in nature, wave.

<p>Summary : The story of the Gothic, from early architecture and literature to the modern horror genre, illustrated by the beautiful, the macabre and the strange.Crumbling ruins, undead fiends, dark alleys and forests teeming with horrors seen and unseen: the tendrils of the Gothic have crept out of the architecture of churches, mosques and grand houses and into suburban malls, overcrowded cities, the deserted corners of the world and beyond, taking the shape of monsters from Beowulf to Gojira, Cthulhu or the wendigo to our own terrifying, warped reflections. Across time, form and media, this book traces the weaving path of the Gothic from the shadows of history to the very heart of popular culture today.</p>

<p>Summary : In bestselling author T L Swan?s second hot installment to the Miles High Club series, he?s sexy, rich, and her mortal enemy. Hate never felt so good.  I first met Tristan Miles at a meeting where he was trying to take over my late husband?s company. He was powerful, arrogant, and infuriatingly gorgeous, and I hated him with every cell in my body. In the shock of the century, he called me three days later and asked me on a date. I would rather die than date a man like him?though I do have to admit it was good for the ego. Turning him down was the highlight of my year. Six months later, he was the guest speaker at a conference I attended in France. Still arrogant and infuriating?but this time, surprisingly charming and witty. When he looked at me, I got butterflies. But I can?t go there. He?s just a player in a hot suit, and I?m just a widow with three unruly sons. I just need this conference to be over. Because everybody knows that Tristan Miles always gets what he wants?and what he </p>

In the simmering summer where everything changes, Charlie learns why the truth of things is so hard to know, and even harder to hold in his heart.From the Hardcover edition.</p>

<p>Summary : It was easy to hate Rhett Kline&#8230; and even easier to sleep with him.Teddy Anderson had a fool-proof plan. Famous last words, right?She would breeze through her last year teaching and then make her break out to Hollywood.Too bad the new principal at her school is Rhett Kline, former Copper Springs golden boy and the same guy who ghosted Teddy after she forked over her V-card their senior year.He?s still got that great head of hair and the kind of dimples that could make a girl swoon. He?s also still got that aggravating swagger and over-confidence that could make a girl punch him square in the jaw.Teddy plans on keeping her distance and getting through the year without incident. But the one time she falters in her resolve, Rhett has got Teddy?s plans?and her panties?in all sorts of knots.It?s not fair that someone so infuriating can be so tempting. If Teddy lowers her walls and lets go of her meticulous plans, is she putting herself at risk of getting her heart broken by the same guy </p>

<p>Summary : Ten years ago, Calamity came. It was a burst in the sky that gave ordinary people extraordinary powers. The awed public started calling them Epics.?? Epics are no friends of man. With incredible gifts came the desire to rule. And to rule man, you must crush his will.?? Now, in what was once Chicago, an astonishingly powerful Epic named Steelheart has installed himself as emperor. Steelheart possesses the strength of ten men and can control the elements. It is said that no bullet can harm him, no sword can split his skin, and no fire can burn him. He is invincible. Nobody fights back . . . nobody but the Reckoners.?? A shadowy group of ordinary humans, the Reckoners spend their lives studying Epics, finding their weaknesses, and then assassinating them. And David wants in.?? When Steelheart came to Chicago, he killed David?s father. For years, like the Reckoners, David has been studying, and planning, and he has something they need. Not an object, but an experience.?? He has seen </p>

<p>Summary : Als Gesicht der Band Tokio Hotel wurde Bill Kaulitz f?r sein exzentrisches Auftreten geliebt, bel?chelt bewundert und gehasst wie kein Zweiter. Fans verehrten seinen androgynen Style, die Presse reagierte mit Ratlosigkeit und Spekulationen ?ber seine sexuelle Identit?t. Als der Rummel um die eigene Person gef?hrliche Ausma?e annahm, floh Bill mit seinem Zwillingsbruder Tom nach Los Angeles.Von dort blickt er auf die ersten drei?ig Jahre seines Lebens zur?ck. Aufgewachsen in der N?he von Magdeburg, war Bill Anfeindungen und Unverst?ndnis gewohnt, lie? sich aber nie beirren und verfolgte konsequent seine k?nstlerischen Visionen und seinen Traum eines Lebens abseits von provinzieller Enge. Zum ersten Mal erz?hlt er hier offen von seiner Kindheit im Nirgendwo, von Tokio Hotels ?berw?ltigendem Erfolg, aber auch von Eskapaden, Einsamkeit und der besonderen Beziehung zu seinem Bruder Tom.</p>

<p>Summary : Her city is under siege.The zombies are coming back.And all Nona wants is a birthday party.In many ways, Nona is like other people. She lives with her family, has a job at her local school, and loves walks on the beach and meeting new dogs. But Nona&#8217;s not like other people. Six months ago she woke up in a stranger&#8217;s body, and she&#8217;s afraid she might have to give it back.The whole city is falling to pieces. A monstrous blue sphere hangs on the horizon, ready to tear the planet apart. Blood of Eden forces have surrounded the last Cohort facility and wait for the Emperor Undying to come calling. Their leaders want Nona to be the weapon that will save them from the Nine Houses. Nona would prefer to live an ordinary life with the people she loves, with Pyrrha and Camilla and Palamedes, but she also knows that nothing lasts forever.And each night, Nona dreams of a woman with a skull-painted face&#8230;</p>

<p>Summary : This book takes the reader on a fantastic journey through a wide range of cultures and traditions to examine the phenomenon of ecstatic visionary experiences?from Sumerian Gilgamesh and the Taoist Immortals to the imaginative fiction of Jorge Luis Borges. The author provides a comprehensive tour of otherworldly journeys common from immemorial times among shamans, magicians, and witches, and illustrates their connection with such modern phenomena as altered states of consciousness, out-of-body experiences, and near-death experiences.</p>

<p>Summary : Ethanol: Science and Engineering reviews the most significant research findings in both ethanol production and utilization. The book&#8217;s contents are divided into four parts, beginning with an explanation of the chemical reactions involved during the conversion of ethanol to more complex molecules. Other sections focus on various processes and their potential use, the modelling of various chemical processes, and finally, their economic and environmental impact. The book includes the most advanced production processes, new technologies, applications, and the economic role ethanol plays today. The book will be great for researchers and engineers in both academic and industry.The idea of using ethanol as a fuel is one of the most promising options in the arena of alternative fuels because of it versatile use as an intermediate for producing hydrogen via reforming reactions, direct fuel cells feed and/or its production from biomass, which is also considered a sustainable feedstock.Reviews </p>

Not necessarily, says Sara Goldrick-Rab, and with Paying the Price, she shows in damning detail exactly why. Quite simply, college is far too expensive for many people today, and the confusing mix of federal, state, institutional, and private financial aid leaves countless students without the resources they need to pay for it. ? Drawing on an unprecedented study of 3,000 young adults who entered public colleges and universities in Wisconsin in 2008 with the support of federal aid and Pell Grants, Goldrick-Rab reveals the devastating effect of these shortfalls.

<p>Summary : <br />
   Four sisters have become queens, rulers of all that Aerthlan&#8217;s two moons embrace. The last sister will forge her own path . . . <br />
Signs and SealsRaised on the magic-seeped Isle of Moon, Maeve is used to unusual powers&#8211;and the way they fuel the politics of her world. But when she discovers an ability to shape-shift at will, she knows who she wants to share it with first. Brody, the enigmatic, infuriating shifter-spy has always made time for Maeve. But it&#8217;s been almost two months since she&#8217;s seen him.

<p>Summary : Prominent political commentator, author, and columnist for The Australian, Niki Savva takes a penetrating look at the relationship between Tony Abbott and Peta Credlin. In The Road to Ruin, she argues that Tony Abbott took more offence at criticism of Credlin than of himself, and that he took her word above that of his colleagues. And that this led to his ruin.On the night of 15 July 2014, The Australian marked its 50th birthday with a star-studded celebration in Sydney. Tony Abbott was talking to the paper&#8217;s editor at large, Paul Kelly. As I approached, the prime minister called out a cheery hello. Instantly, protective radar went up. The last time I saw him he could barely speak to me so I was on my guard.In the middle of our handshake, he said, &#8216;Now, Niki, can you please stop criticising my chief of staff.&#8221;Why?&#8217; I asked.&#8217;Because,&#8217; he said, &#8216;Sometimes when ministers tell you things, they are not true.&#8221;You know what, Tony? Sometimes they are.&#8217;</p>

<p>Summary : Trip. My parents started using that word about a year ago??one day, you?lltake a trip to be with us. Like an adventure.?Javier Zamora?s adventure is a 3,000-mile journey from his small town inEl Salvador, through Guatemala and Mexico, and across the U.S. border.He will leave behind his beloved aunt and grandparents to reunite with amother who left four years ago and a father he barely remembers. Travelingalone amid a group of strangers and a ?coyote? hired to lead them to safety,Javier expects his trip to last two short weeks.At nine years old, all Javier can imagine is rushing into his parents? arms,snuggling in bed between them, and living under the same roof again. Hecannot foresee the perilous boat trips, relentless desert treks, pointed guns,arrests and deceptions that await him; nor can he know that those twoweeks will expand into two life-altering months alongside fellow migrantswho will come to encircle him like an unexpected family.A memoir as gripping as it is moving, </p>

<p>Summary : It is the morning of the reaping that will kick off the tenth annual Hunger Games. In the Capital, eighteen-year-old Coriolanus Snow is preparing for his one shot at glory as a mentor in the Games. The once-mighty house of Snow has fallen on hard times, its fate hanging on the slender chance that Coriolanus will be able to outcharm, outwit, and outmaneuver his fellow students to mentor the winning tribute.The odds are against him. He&#8217;s been given the humiliating assignment of mentoring the female tribute from District 12, the lowest of the low. Their fates are now completely intertwined &#8212; every choice Coriolanus makes could lead to favor or failure, triumph or ruin. Inside the arena, it will be a fight to the death. Outside the arena, Coriolanus starts to feel for his doomed tribute&#8230; and must weigh his need to follow the rules against his desire to survive no matter what it takes.</p>

<p>Summary : In 1963, Annie Ernaux, 23 and unattached, realizes she is pregnant. Shame arises in her like a plague: understanding that her pregnancy will mark her and her family as social failures, she knows she cannot keep that child. This is the story, written forty years later, of a trauma Ernaux never overcame. In a France where abortion was illegal, she attempted, in vain, to self-administer the abortion with a knitting needle. Fearful and desperate, she finally located an abortionist, and ends up in a hospital emergency ward where she nearly dies. In Happening, Ernaux sifts through her memories and her journal entries dating from those days. Clearly, cleanly, she gleans the meanings of her experience.</p>

<p>Summary : Based on the research that race, gender, consent, and body positivity should be discussed with toddlers on up, this read-aloud board book series offers adults the opportunity to begin important conversations with young children in an informed, safe, and supported way.Developed by experts in the fields of early childhood and activism against injustice, this topic-driven board book offers clear, concrete language and beautiful imagery that young children can grasp and adults can leverage for further discussion.While young children are avid observers and questioners of their world, adults often shut down or postpone conversations on complicated topics because it&#8217;s hard to know where to begin. Research shows that talking about issues like race and gender from the age of two not only helps children understand what they see, but also increases self-awareness, self-esteem, and allows them to recognize and confront things that are unfair, like discrimination and prejudice.This first book in </p>

<p>Summary : For over thirty years, News: The Politics of Illusion has not simply reflected the political communication field?it has played a major role in shaping it. Today, the familiar news organizations of the legacy press are operating in a fragmenting and expanding mediaverse that resembles a big bang of proliferating online competitors that are challenging the very definition of news itself. Audience-powered sites such as the Huffington Post and Vox blend conventional political reporting with opinion blogs, celebrity gossip, and other ephemera aimed at getting clicks and shares. At the same time, the rise of serious investigative organizations such as ProPublica presents yet a different challenge to legacy journalism. Lance Bennett?s thoroughly revised tenth edition offers the most up-to-date guide to understanding how and why the media and news landscapes are being transformed.

<p>Summary : For over thirty years, News: The Politics of Illusion has not simply reflected the political communication field?it has played a major role in shaping it. Today, the familiar news organizations of the legacy press are operating in a fragmenting and expanding mediaverse that resembles a big bang of proliferating online competitors that are challenging the very definition of news itself. Audience-powered sites such as the Huffington Post and Vox blend conventional political reporting with opinion blogs, celebrity gossip, and other ephemera aimed at getting clicks and shares. At the same time, the rise of serious investigative organizations such as ProPublica presents yet a different challenge to legacy journalism. Lance Bennett?s thoroughly revised tenth edition offers the most up-to-date guide to understanding how and why the media and news landscapes are being transformed. It explains the mix of old and new, and points to possible outcomes. Where areas of change are clearly </p>

<p>Summary : Una esclarecedora revisi?n de los costos y beneficios de las principales pol?ticas p?blicas, programas y proyectos de la Administraci?n de AMLO.??Por qu? llegamos a este precipicio?? parecen preguntarse los mexicanos ante el desastre. La respuesta de Macario Schettino se reduce a un nombre: Andr?s Manuel L?pez Obrador. El autoritarismo, los atavismos, las ocurrencias y el desprecio por instituciones que han sido creadas a lo largo de d?cadas, han llevado al pa?s a una ruina no solo econ?mica, sino moral.Schettino aporta datos acerca de la econom?a del pa?s y de los proyectos alucinantes del presidente. Desde la perspectiva de un profesional de la econom?a y de la administraci?n p?blica, vemos c?mo las ideas y fantas?as de L?pez Obrador han conducido a M?xico a varias tragedias innecesarias: covid-19, explosi?n en Tlahuelilpan, desabasto de medicamentos y, claro, la militarizaci?n del pa?s.Un texto breve pero sustancioso para documentar el pesimismo y, a partir de ah?, planear la </p>

<p>Summary : This readable, affordable, and faith-friendly introduction to the Bible aids students as they engage in their first informed reading of the biblical text in an academic setting. The authors, who have significant undergraduate teaching experience, approach the Christian Scriptures from historical, literary, and theological perspectives. The book is designed for a one-semester course and is meant to be read alongside the biblical text, enabling students to become educated readers of the Bible. In the process, it introduces critical perspectives and approaches without undermining the theological claims found in the Christian Scriptures. The book includes text boxes, illustrations, maps, and suggestions for further reading and is supplemented by web-based pedagogical resources.</p>

<p>Summary : In Selenoth, the race of Man is on the ascendant. The ancient dragons sleep, the evil Witchkings are no more, their evil power destroyed by the courage of Men and the fearsome magic of the Elves. The dwarves have retreated to the kingdoms of the Underdeep, the trolls hide in their mountains, and even the most savage orc tribes have learned to dread the iron discipline of the mighty Amorran legions.

<p>Summary : Eva Ibbotson has proven that romantic fiction can be funny, well written, and even a little erudite. Her novel Magic Flutes won the Romantic Novelists Association award and, along with A Company of Swans, was a Booklist Editors&#8217; Choice selection. The New York Times said of Madensky Square that &#8220;she has fine-tuned-and perhaps even enlarged-the [romantic] genre.&#8221;In this delightful collection are some of the best of Ibbotson&#8217;s short stories. They range from nineteeth-century Vienna to the north of England at the end of the last century, from prerevolutionary Russia to the devastated Brazilian Amazon. Each setting is magically recreated and peopled with the remarkable, memorable characters that are Ibbotson&#8217;s trademark.Here , in &#8220;A Glove Shop in Vienna,&#8221; the title story, Great-Uncle Max is torn between his grand and secret passion for Susie, the enchanting glove shop assistant, and the devotion of his large, opera singer wife. Here is Miss Bennett, drama mistress at the fading Markham </p>

<p>Summary : What would you call a group of Goddesses that wear garlands of skull, while the other drinks her own blood? A Goddess with incomparable beauty while the other is a crone. A Goddess that loves leftovers while the other demands cleanliness. This book discusses Dasha Mahavidyas &#8211; one of the most important Goddesses of Tantra.As the laws of science define energy as primordial ever existent, that is utilized through a medium, similarly, Dasha Mahavidyas are the primordial Sakti or energy, that creates, destroys, and sustains the universe. They are Mahavidyas or ?Great Knowledge? where each Goddess has something distinct to teach. Every Goddess in the book is dealt independently &#8211; illustrating appearance, stories of origin, symbolism, various forms and relation to other Goddesses, Mantras, Yantra, Sadhana procedure, temples and any parallels that can be drawn from other cultures. Tantra is often perceived as black magic, voodoo or art of love, but in reality, Tantra is ?A way of life? that </p>

<p>Summary : On a remote and mysterious island, one man builds a playground of hedonistic excess ? replete with waterfalls, grand palaces, and gardens ? a backdrop for his decadent feasts, orgies, and dark secrets.Set in 1920s Japan, The Strange Tale of Panorama Island follows the twisted path of failed novelist Hitomi, who bears an uncanny resemblance to the son of a rich industrialist family. Hitomi learns of the rich man&#8217;s sudden passing and creates a desperate plan. He fakes his own death, digs up and hides the other man&#8217;s body, and then washes himself up starving on a beach near the home of the dead man&#8217;s family. After successfully impersonating the now-dead son, Hitomi takes over all aspects of the industrialist&#8217;s life, including his company, his fortune, and eventually his wife. The failed author soon redirects the family&#8217;s wealth to his own perverse aims.A graphic novel based on the revered novella by Edogawa Rampo. Rampo was the godfather of Japanese pulp mysteries. Stunning artwork by </p>

<p>Summary : Cas Lowood has inherited an unusual vocation: He kills the dead.So did his father before him, until he was gruesomely murdered by a ghost he sought to kill. Now, armed with his father&#8217;s mysterious and deadly athame, Cas travels the country with his kitchen-witch mother and their spirit-sniffing cat. They follow legends and local lore, destroy the murderous dead, and keep pesky things like the future and friends at bay.Searching for a ghost the locals call Anna Dressed in Blood, Cas expects the usual: track, hunt, kill. What he finds instead is a girl entangled in curses and rage, a ghost like he&#8217;s never faced before. She still wears the dress she wore on the day of her brutal murder in 1958: once white, now stained red and dripping with blood. Since her death, Anna has killed any and every person who has dared to step into the deserted Victorian she used to call home.Yet she spares Cas&#8217;s life.</p>

<p>Summary : St. Philaret of Moscow is the Russian Chrysostom. His mouth overflowed from a heart enlarged and illumined by the Holy Spirit, and his teaching has been a fountain of life to the Christian generations that have succeeded the great bishop. Here, for the first time in an English-language translation, we have a thematic collection of his sermons dedicated to living the Christian life. The Master Pedagogue covers numerous foundational spiritual realities including being born again, building a life upon the foundation of the fear of God, the centrality of gratitude, the cultivation of zeal, the purification of the heart, the nourishing of poverty of spirit, as well as more targeted subjects such as childbearing, work, preparations for prayer, and how to consecrate Sunday to God. These pages contain a feast of faith and soul guidance that, if followed, will bring forth abundant spiritual treasure.</p>

The Master Pedagogue covers numerous foundational spiritual realities including being born again, building a life upon the foundation of the fear of God, the centrality of gratitude, the cultivation of zeal, the purification of the heart, the nourishing of poverty of spirit, as well as more targeted subjects such as childbearing, work, preparations for prayer, and how to consecrate Sunday to God. These pages contain a feast of faith and soul guidance that, if followed, will bring forth abundant spiritual treasure.</p>

<p>Summary : Una novela sat?rica sobre la tiran?a de la Navidad.Imaginad un a?o sin Navidad. Sin centros comerciales abarrotados, sin cenas de empresa, sin pasteles de frutas, sin regalos rid?culos.

<p>Summary : Winnifred &#8220;Win&#8221; McNulty has always been wildly independent. Not one to be coddled for her limb difference, Win has spent most of her life trying to prove that she can do it all on her own. And, with some minor adjustments, she&#8217;s done just fine. That is until she has a one-night stand with the incredibly charming Bo, a perfect stranger. And that one night changes everything. While Bo is surprisingly elated to step up to the plate, Win finds herself unsure of whether she can handle this new challenge on her own or if she?ll need a helping hand. Together, Win and Bo decide to get to know one another as friends and nothing more. But, as they both should know by now, life rarely goes according to plan.</p>

<p>Summary : A powerful, moving memoir about what it&#8217;s like to be a student of colour on a predominantly white campus.A booksmart kid from Toronto, Eternity Martis was excited to move away to Western University for her undergraduate degree. But as one of the few Black students there, she soon discovered that the campus experiences she&#8217;d seen in movies were far more complex in reality. Over the next four years, Eternity learned more about what someone like her brought out in other people than she did about herself. She was confronted by white students in blackface at parties, dealt with being the only person of colour in class and was tokenized by her romantic partners. She heard racial slurs in bars, on the street, and during lectures. And she gathered labels she never asked for: Abuse survivor. Token. Bad feminist. But, by graduation, she found an unshakeable sense of self?and a support network of other women of colour.Using her award-winning reporting skills, Eternity connects her own </p>

<p>Summary : Sharing a summer house with a hot-as-hell roommate should be a dream come true, right? Not when it?s Justin? the only person I?d ever loved? who now hates me.When my grandmother died and left me half of the house on Aquidneck Island, there was a catch: the other half would go to the boy she helped raise.The same boy who turned into the teenager whose heart I broke years ago.The same teenager who?s now a man with a hard body and a hardass personality to match.I hadn?t seen him in years, and now we?re living together because neither one of us is willing to give up the house.The worst part? He didn?t come alone.I?d soon realize there?s a thin line between love and hate. I could see through that smug smile. Beneath it all?the boy is still there. So is our connection. The problem is?now that I can?t have Justin, I?ve never wanted him more.</p>
