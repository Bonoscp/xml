But none of that mattered until them.Ryder, Gage, Dex, Holden, and Leo are my life, my loves, and in the blink of an eye, it was ripped away from me.At twenty-two, I rose to power as the first female Boss of the Italian Mafia, and at twenty-five, I almost died because of it. I didn&#8217;t take the threat of a deranged stalker seriously, and it could cost me and Zane, a former love, our lives and sanity.With one of my guys? lives hanging in the balance, my other guys must fight to save him while trying to save me. Will they succeed, or would someone meet their certain death before it?s their time?Nothing in this life is certain. You don&#8217;t always get what you want, and you could lose everything you just realized you needed. One thing I was sure of? I knew what I would get after we got out of this hell alive.Revenge.**Riches To </p>

In Clean, doctor and journalist James Hamblin explores how we got here, examining the science and culture of how we care for our skin today. He talks to dermatologists, microbiologists, allergists, immunologists, aestheticians, bar-soap enthusiasts, venture capitalists, Amish people, theologians, and straight-up scam artists, trying to figure out what it really means to be </p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  Dominic was staring at me like he couldn?t decide whether to chop me into pieces or pull my hair and French kiss me.Dominic <br />
I got her fired. Okay, so I?d had a bad day and took it out on a bystander in a pizza shop. But there?s nothing innocent about Ally Morales. She proves that her first day of her new job? in my office? after being hired by my mother.So maybe her colorful, annoying, inexplicably alluring personality brightens up the magazine?s offices that have felt like a prison for the past year. Maybe I like that she argues with me in front of the editorial staff. And maybe my after-hours fantasies are haunted by those brown eyes and that sharp tongue.But that doesn?t mean that I?m going to be the next Russo man to take advantage of his position. I might be a second-generation asshole, but I am not my father.She?s working herself to death at half a dozen dead-end jobs for some secret reason she doesn?t feel like sharing with me. And I?m going to fix it all. Don?t accuse me </p>

<p>Summary : Twelve-year-old Fee is a shy Korean American boy and a newly named section leader of the first sopranos in his local boys? choir. But when Fee learns how the director treats his section leaders, he is so ashamed he says nothing of the abuse, not even when Peter, his best friend, is in line to be next. When the director is arrested, Fee tries to forgive himself for his silence. But when Peter takes his own life, Fee blames only himself. In the years that follow he slowly builds a new life, teaching near his hometown. There he meets a young student who is the picture of Peter and is forced to confront the past he believed was gone. Told with ?the force of a dream and the heft of a life,?* Edinburgh marked Chee ?as a major talent whose career will bear watching? (Publishers Weekly). ??A coming-of-age tale in the grand Romantic tradition, where passions run high, Cupid stalks Psyche, and love shares the dance floor with death . . . A lovely, nuanced, never predictable portrait of a </p>

A vicious storm killed his engine and the current dragged his boat out to sea. The storm picked up and blasted him west. When he washed ashore on January 29, 2014, he had arrived in the Marshall Islands, 9,000 miles away?equivalent to traveling from New York to Moscow round trip.For fourteen months, Alvarenga survived constant shark attacks. He learned to catch fish with his bare hands. He built a fish net from a pair of empty plastic bottles. Taking apart the outboard motor, he fashioned a huge fishhook. Using fish vertebrae as needles, he stitched together his own clothes.He considered suicide on multiple occasions?including offering himself up to a pack of sharks.

<p>Summary : <br />
  Everything has a price. <br />
Railway magnate Tom Severin is wealthy and powerful enough to satisfy any desire as soon as it arises. Anything?or anyone?is his for the asking. It should be simple to find the perfect wife?and from his first glimpse of Lady Cassandra Ravenel, he?s determined to have her. But the beautiful and quick-witted Cassandra is equally determined to marry for love?the one thing he can?t give. <br />
  Everything except her. <br />
Severin is the most compelling and attractive man Cassandra has ever met, even if his heart is frozen. But she has no interest in living in the fast-paced world of a ruthless man who always plays to win. When a newfound enemy nearly destroys Cassandra?s reputation, Severin seizes the opportunity he?s been waiting for. As always, he gets what he wants?or does he? There?s one lesson Tom Severin has yet to learn from his new bride: never underestimate a Ravenel.The chase for Cassandra?s hand may be over. But the chase for her heart has only just begun . . .</p>

<p>Summary : The leading edition of the original text of the New Testament, this scholarly edition is designed for extensive research, textual criticism, and other academic studies. In keeping with the goals of serious and advanced New Testament scholars, the revised critical apparatus shows a nearly exhaustive list of variants but includes only the most significant witnesses for each variant. The Greek text has paragraph and section breaks. Cross references in the margins are extensive and include synoptic parallels. Five appendices offer in-depth information for further understanding of passages. The introduction appears in both English and German. Text, notes, and critical apparatus appear in a clear font throughout the volume. The text is also available with a Greek-English Dictionary by Barclay Newman.

Roll. And when she can?t find motherly support in her own home, she finds sanctuary with Andy El, the Salish woman who runs the trailer park.</p>

<p>Summary : Even now something is missing from the history of Vietnam. Behind the burning sense of horror and betrayal the personal stories remain untold. No one has bothered to talk to the men and women who went to Vietnam and fought the war.What happened to boys and girls straight out of school who were plunged from the basketball park into the napalm jungle? Who were they fighting for? How did conscripts and volunteers live through the war and how can they live with the scars?Mark Baker recorded conversations with dozens of Vietnam veterans. NAM is a unique and harrowing collection of those interviews, as raw and shocking as an open wound. This is the story of the human cost of a war that had no survivors, only veterans.</p>

<p>Summary : From USA Today bestselling author Julianne MacLean comes a suspenseful, emotionally charged novel that explores the secrets and hidden truths within a seemingly perfect marriage.Abbie MacIntyre is living the dream in the picturesque Nova Scotia town she calls home.

When a drunk driver hits her car, Abbie is rushed to the hospital. She survives, but the accident forces unimaginable secrets out into the open and plagues Abbie with nightmares so vivid that she starts to question her grip on reality. Her perfect life begins to crack, and those cracks threaten to shatter her world completely.The search for answers will test her strength in every way?as a wife, a career woman, and a mother?but it may also open the door for Abbie to move forward, beyond anger and heartbreak, to find out what she is </p>

<p>Summary : Breaks down the most commonly held misconceptions about lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people and their lives ?&#8221;You Can Tell Just by Looking&#8221; unpacks enduring, popular, and deeply held myths about lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people, culture, and life in America. Some of these myths, such as &#8220;all religions condemn homosexuality,&#8221; have been used to justify discrimination and oppression of LGBT people. Other myths, such as &#8220;LGBT people are born that way,&#8221; have been adopted by LGBT communities and their allies. By discussing and dispelling these myths?including gay-positive ones?the authors challenge readers to question their own beliefs and to grapple with the complexities of what it means to be queer in the broadest social, political, and cultural sense.</p>

<p>Summary : The World Fantasy Award-winning third volume of the LYONESSE trilogy brings attention to the faerie changeling Madouc. Where princess Suldrun once meekly endured the proprieties of Castle Haidion, Madouc defends herself with rotten fruit. Vexed, King Casmir arranges a contest to marry her off, but Madouc has other ideas, and enlists the stableboy &#8220;Sir Pom-pom&#8221; on an impromptu quest to find her father. During their travels, they encounter swindlers, faeries, trolls, ogres, a knight in search of his youth, and a relatively pedestrian item known as the Holy Grail. As the sorcerers Shimrod and Murgen investigate portents of cataclysm in the world of magic, Casmir plans a murder that will bring all the lands under his iron rule; however, his ambitions will be complicated by one small but important oversight-he&#8217;s failed to allow for Madouc!</p>

<p>Summary : Explore present and future energy needs as well as options for continued use of fossil fuels and alternative energy sources with Dunlap&#8217;s SUSTAINABLE ENERGY, 2nd Edition. Individual chapters thoroughly investigate each energy approach as the book covers both current energy production and future strategies. The author assumes you are familiar with basic concepts of freshman-level physics and chemistry. This edition emphasizes the complexity of energy issues and need for a multidisciplinary approach to solving energy problems. Quantitative end-of-chapter problems help you practice analyzing information, correlating data from various sources, and interpreting graphical data and interpolate values. You see real problems in producing and using energy as you realize that while exact calculations are important, a broad-based analysis is often most appropriate.</p>

The author assumes you are familiar with basic concepts of freshman-level physics and chemistry. This edition emphasizes the complexity of energy issues and need for a multidisciplinary approach to solving energy problems. Quantitative end-of-chapter problems help you practice analyzing information, correlating data from various sources, and interpreting graphical data and interpolate values. You see real problems in producing and using energy as you realize that while exact calculations are important, a broad-based analysis is often most appropriate.</p>

<p>Summary : When a rockstar and a single mom become roommates, delicious sparks are bound to fly.Rockstar Hudson Mitchell is over the glitz and spotlight of the music industry. Desperate for a break from the fast-paced life of fame, he retreats to the one place that has always been home.Brooksville, California. It&#8217;s the same place where Charlie has taken refuge, trying to build a life for herself and her young daughter. The quiet, small-town atmosphere and her new bakery venture are exactly what she needs to pick up the pieces of her shattered past.As they spend more time together, neither of them is prepared for the effect Charlie has on Hudson, and how important she would become for his career.</p>

A essere i pi? ricchi, i pi? potenti. E ci riescono: in breve tempo, i fratelli Paolo e Ignazio rendono la loro bottega di spezie la migliore della citt?, poi avviano il commercio di zolfo, acquistano case e terreni dagli spiantati nobili palermitani, creano una loro compagnia di navigazione? E quando Vincenzo, figlio di Paolo, prende in mano Casa Florio, lo slancio continua, inarrestabile: nelle cantine Florio, un vino da poveri ? il marsala ? viene trasformato in un nettare degno della tavola di un re; a Favignana, un metodo rivoluzionario per conservare il tonno ? sott?olio e in lattina ? ne rilancia il consumo in tutta Europa?

Questa ? la sua storia.Dal momento in cui sbarcano a Palermo da Bagnara Calabra, nel 1799, i Florio guardano avanti, irrequieti e ambiziosi, decisi ad arrivare pi? in alto di tutti.

E quando Vincenzo, figlio di Paolo, prende in mano Casa Florio, lo slancio continua, inarrestabile: nelle cantine Florio, un vino da poveri ? il marsala ? viene trasformato in un nettare degno della tavola di un re; a Favignana, un metodo rivoluzionario per conservare il tonno ? sott?olio e in lattina ? ne rilancia il consumo in tutta Europa? In tutto ci?, Palermo osserva con stupore </p>

<p>Summary : Moomins sleep through the winter ? or they did until the year Moomintroll woke up ?The Moomins, in case you didn?t know, are kind, philosophical creatures with velvety fur and smooth round snouts, who live in a tall blue house in a beautiful woodland valley, beside the sea. They love the sunshine and sleep all through the winter months, waking up when spring arrives.Except one year when Moomintroll accidentally awakes and nds himself stranded and alone in a mysterious world blanketed with snow. In Moominland Midwinter we follow Moomin as he overcomes his amazement and isolation and, with the help of the wise Too-ticky and the fearless Little My, begins to explore the glittering new landscape.</p>

<p>Summary : Eryk e sua madre, Lena, hanno trascorso la loro esistenza fuggendo incessantemente da un luogo all?altro, con la convinzione che, forse, per loro non esista proprio un porto sicuro. Perch? entrambi non solo sono Grisha, ma sono i pi? potenti e letali tra loro. Temuti da chi vorrebbe ucciderli e braccati da chi vorrebbe sfruttarne i doni, devono cercare di tenere nascoste le loro capacit? ovunque vadano. Ma talvolta i segreti pi? pericolosi trovano comunque il modo di venire a galla?Questo graphic novel, scritto da Leigh Bardugo e illustrato da Dani Pendergast, ? il prequel di &#8220;Tenebre e Ossa&#8221;, tassello indispensabile del GrishaVerse che permette di gettare un po&#8217; di luce sulle origini di un destino tanto grandioso quanto sinistro, quello del temuto e potentissimo Oscuro</p>

<p>Summary : The East India Company was the largest commercial enterprise in British history, yet its roots in Tudor England are often overlooked. The Tudor revolution in commerce led ambitious merchants to search for new forms of investment, not least in risky overseas enterprises?and for these ?adventurers? the most profitable bet of all would be on the Company. Through a host of stories and fascinating details, David Howarth brings to life the Company?s way of doing business?from the leaky ships and petty seafarers of its embattled early days to later sweeping commercial success. While the Company?s efforts met with disappointment in Japan, they sowed the seeds of success in India, setting the outline for what would later become the Raj. Drawing on an abundance of sources, Howarth shows how competition from European powers was vital to success?and considers whether the Company was truly ?English? at all, or rather part of a Europe-wide movement.</p>

<p>Summary : Storm, shipwreck, survival. Chris Vick&#8217;s novel delves deep into the might and majesty of the unpredictable ocean, the strength of an unlikely friendship between a British boy and a Berber girl and their will to survive against all the odds.A young British boy called Bill narrowly survives the sinking of his yacht in a huge storm off the coast of Morocco. After many days alone at sea in a small boat he rescues another survivor, clinging for her life to a barrel. She is a girl called Aya, from the nomadic Berber tribe, whose migrant ship was destroyed by the same storm. Through endless days, a mere speck on the vast, empty sea ? hungry, sunburned, and with no idea what will happen next ? Aya recounts the tales of Shahrazad of the Arabian Nights, who told 1000 stories to quell the murderous desire of the Persian King. As hope of rescue begins to fade, from Aya&#8217;s tales of magic, brave heroes, wily thieves, greedy kings and cruel sultans, they find the strength they need to stay </p>

<p>Summary : Every Saturday, Pawcasso trots into town with a basket, a shopping list, and cash in paw to buy groceries for his family. One day, he passes eleven-year-old Jo, peering out the window of her house, bored and lonely. Astonished by the sight of an adorable basket-toting dog on his own, Jo follows Pawcasso, and when she?s seen alongside him by a group of kids from her school, they mistake her for Pawcasso?s owner. Excited to make new friends, Jo reluctantly hides the truth and agrees to let ?her? dog model for an art class the kids attend. What could go wrong? But what starts as a Chihuahua-sized lie quickly grows Great Dane-sized when animal control receives complaints about a dog roaming the streets off-leash. With Pawcasso?s freedom at stake, is Jo willing to spill the truth and risk her new friendships?</p>

Astonished by the sight of an adorable basket-toting dog on his own, Jo follows Pawcasso, and when she?s seen alongside him by a group of kids from her school, they mistake her for Pawcasso?s owner. Excited to make new friends, Jo reluctantly hides the truth and agrees to let ?her? dog model for an art class the kids attend. What could go wrong? But what starts as a Chihuahua-sized lie quickly grows Great Dane-sized when animal control receives complaints about a dog roaming the streets off-leash. With Pawcasso?s freedom at stake, is Jo willing to spill the truth and risk her new friendships?</p>

<p>Summary : A grown-up and depressed Peter Pan is fighting to protect Neverland from the realm-conquering Commodore Hook. When Peter&#8217;s runaway shadow shows up at Wendy&#8217;s workplace, she&#8217;s eager for the chance to visit Neverland again, to help protect it&#8211;and sure, to see the Fae man she&#8217;s been in love with for ten years. But Neverland is far different than Wendy remembers, with monsters both literal and human-shaped threatening everything Peter has tried to build.This book is perfect for everyone who loved Peter Pan as a kid and secretly wants a spicy Fae version! (Adult romance, mild-to-medium heat, cliffhanger ending with HEA in book 2)Trigger warnings and content warnings can be found on the author&#8217;s website or in the front matter of the book.</p>

<p>Summary : Nelson Mandela is one of the great moral and political leaders of our time: an international hero whose lifelong dedication to the fight against racial oppression in South Africa won him the Nobel Peace Prize and the presidency of his country. Since his triumphant release in 1990 from more than a quarter-century of imprisonment, Mandela has been at the center of the most compelling and inspiring political drama in the world. As president of the African National Congress and head of South Africa&#8217;s anti-apartheid movement, he was instrumental in moving the nation toward multiracial government and majority rule. He is revered everywhere as a vital force in the fight for human rights and racial equality. The foster son of a Thembu chief, Mandela was raised in the traditional, tribal culture of his ancestors, but at an early age learned the modern, inescapable reality of what came to be called apartheid, one of the most powerful and effective systems of oppression ever conceived.

<p>Summary : On a bitter-cold day, in the December of his junior year at Harvard, Sam Masur exits a subway car and sees, amid the hordes of people waiting on the platform, Sadie Green. He calls her name. For a moment, she pretends she hasn?t heard him, but then, she turns, and a game begins: a legendary collaboration that will launch them to stardom. These friends, intimates since childhood, borrow money, beg favors, and, before even graduating college, they have created their first blockbuster, Ichigo. Overnight, the world is theirs. Not even twenty-five years old, Sam and Sadie are brilliant, successful, and rich, but these qualities won?t protect them from their own creative ambitions or the betrayals of their hearts.In this exhilarating novel two friends?often in love, but never lovers?come together as creative partners in the world of video game design, where success brings them fame, joy, tragedy, duplicity, and, ultimately, a kind of immortality.</p>

<p>Summary : Veridian lll: A world has been saved, the U.S.S. Enterprise 1701-D lies in ruins, and one of the galaxy&#8217;s greatest heroes rest beneath a simple cairn of rocks on a lonely hillside. But as a legendary Vulcan ambassador comes at last to the grave of his best and dearest friend, the adventure is only beginning. For the Borg and renegades from the Romulan Empire have joined forces in an unholy alliance against the United Federation of Planets, and their ultimate weapon is none other than James T. Kirk, resurrected by mysterious alien science to destroy the Borg&#8217;s most formidable enemy: Jean-Luc Picard. From Deep Space Nine to the Borg Homeworld itself, the battle is joined in the ultimate confrontation between the old generation and the new. Old friends are reunited and ancient secrets revealed, as Riker, Spock, Data, and all of the Federation&#8217;s best and brightest find themselves enmeshed in a cosmic saga that will test their strengths and loyalties to the very limit.</p>

<p>Summary : June and Day have sacrificed so much for the people of the Republic?and each other?and now their country is on the brink of a new existence. June is back in the good graces of the Republic, working within the government&#8217;s elite circles as Princeps-Elect, while Day has been assigned a high-level military position.But neither could have predicted the circumstances that will reunite them: just when a peace treaty is imminent, a plague outbreak causes panic in the Colonies, and war threatens the Republic&#8217;s border cities. This new strain of plague is deadlier than even, and June is the only one who knows the key to her country&#8217;s defense. But saving the lives of thousands will mean asking the one she loves to give up everything.</p>

<p>Summary : Siamo tutti in grado di riconoscere la differenza tra rabbia e paura, tra desiderio e invidia.

Quello di cui non ci rendiamo conto, per?, ? che lo spettro delle emozioni umane ? ancora pi? sfumato di cos?: esistono sensazioni che tutti noi abbiamo provato, stati d&#8217;animo molto precisi e inconfondibili, e a cui per? spesso non abbiamo saputo dare un nome. Eppure in qualche angolo del mondo, in qualche lingua a noi ignota esiste una parola che li definisce: per esempio, solo gli inuit chiamano iktsuarpok il miscuglio di ansia, nervosismo, eccitazione e felicit? che prova chi aspetta l&#8217;arrivo di ospiti a casa, o la risposta a una mail importante; per i finlandesi, kaukokaipuu ? l&#8217;inspiegabile nostalgia per un posto dove non siamo mai stati; gli spagnoli chiamano verg?enza ajena l&#8217;imbarazzo empatico di chi assiste alle figuracce altrui.

Touched by the gesture when it?s obvious she can barely afford to survive, her warm smile and lush body churn up powerful feelings that leave Clay wanting more from her than pie.Melody is running from her past and the small, country town of Garnet is the perfect hiding place.

<p>Summary : The life story of Gary Gygax, godfather of all fantasy adventure games, has been told only in bits and pieces. Michael Witwer has written a dynamic, dramatized biography of Gygax from his childhood in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin to his untimely death in 2008.Gygax&#8217;s magnum opus, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, would explode in popularity throughout the 1970s and &#8217;80s and irreversibly alter the world of gaming. D&amp;D is the best-known, best-selling role-playing game of all time, and it boasts an elite class of alumni&#8211;Stephen Colbert, Robin Williams, and Junot Diaz all have spoken openly about their experience with the game as teenagers, and some credit it as the workshop where their nascent imaginations were fostered.Gygax&#8217;s involvement in the industry lasted long after his dramatic and involuntary departure from D&amp;D&#8217;s parent company, TSR, and his footprint can be seen in the genre he is largely responsible for creating.

Used throughout much of Britain more than a thousand years ago, it is rich with words that haven?t changed (like word), others that are unrecognizable (such as neorxnawang, or paradise), and some that are mystifying even in translation (gafol-fisc, or tax-fish).

<p>Summary : Are you a massage therapist running your own business?You got into massage because you want to help others. And you are great at what you do! So you want it to be successful. You want to help even more clients. And you want to be able to look back and say &#8211; YES! I did that!But when it comes to the business side of things &#8230; let&#8217;s just say maybe &#8220;it&#8217;s not a strength.&#8221;You&#8217;ve posted on social media, you have tried discounting and a letterbox drop, but nothing is working and you&#8217;re not sure where to go next. You&#8217;re stressed out because there&#8217;s so much to do, yet it seems like your hard work isn&#8217;t creating the lifestyle you expected. The passion fades as the bank account drops&#8230; all you want is consistency and to be able to create a long-term career doing what you love.Luckily, we have been there before, with over 29 years of combined experience in massage and business. We made a lot of mistakes on our journey to success, and along the way we learned what works and what doesn&#8217;t. And now </p>

<p>Summary : Parable of the Sower is the Butlerian odyssey of one woman who is twice as feeling in a world that has become doubly dehumanized. The time is 2025. The place is California, where small walled communities must protect themselves from hordes of desperate scavengers and roaming bands of people addicted to a drug that activates an orgasmic desire to burn, rape, and murder. When one small community is overrun, Lauren Olamina, an 18 year old black woman with the hereditary train of ?hyperempathy??which causes her to feel others? pain as her own?sets off on foot along the dangerous coastal highways, moving north into the unknown.</p>

The time is 2025. The place is California, where small walled communities must protect themselves from hordes of desperate scavengers and roaming bands of people addicted to a drug that activates an orgasmic desire to burn, rape, and murder. When one small community is overrun, Lauren Olamina, an 18 year old black woman with the hereditary train of ?hyperempathy??which causes her to feel others? pain as her own?sets off on foot along the dangerous coastal highways, moving north into the unknown.

He occupies himself volunteering as an Exiteer&#8211;someone who sits with terminally ill people as they die by suicide, assisting with logistics and lending moral support, then removing the evidence so that family and friends are not implicated in the death.

<p>Summary : As the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame says,?&#8221;Before the world heard of KISS, the New York Dolls, Marilyn Manson or Ozzy Osbourne, there was Alice Cooper, the original shock-rock band.?When Alice Cooper became the stuff of legend in the early ?70s, their shows were monuments of fun and invention. Riding on a string of hits like ?I?m 18? and ?School?s Out,? they became America?s highest-grossing act, producing four platinum albums and hitting number one on the U.S. and U.K. charts with?Billion Dollar Babies in 1973. Their utterly original?performance style and look, known as Shock Rock,?was swiftly copied by countless bands, including David Bowie and Kiss. Dennis Dunaway, the bassist and co-songwriter for the band, tells a story just as over-the-top crazy as their shows; from struggling for recognition to topping the charts, the Alice Cooper Band was entertaining, outrageous, and one-of-a-kind.The wellspring of creativity was the creative union of two Phoenix teenagers, Dennis Dunaway </p>

<p>Summary : Explore the mega-dungeon of Undermountain in this adventure for the world?s greatest roleplaying game.In the city of Waterdeep rests a tavern called the Yawning Portal, named after the gaping pit in its common room. At the bottom of this crumbling shaft is a labyrinthine dungeon shunned by all but the most daring adventurers. Known as Undermountain, this dungeon is the domain of the mad wizard Halaster Blackcloak. Long has the Mad Mage dwelt in these forlorn depths, seeding his lair with monsters, traps, and mysteries?to what end is a constant source of speculation and concern.? The follow up to Waterdeep: Dragon Heist, Dungeon of the Mad Mage takes adventurers deep into one of D&amp;D&#8217;s biggest dungeons. Each of Undermountain&#8217;s twenty-three levels is an adventure setting unto itself, and the book includes a map for each one.? Waterdeep, known as the City of Splendors, is one of D&amp;D?s most iconic locations. Also the setting for the board game Lords of Waterdeeep, it?s the jewel </p>

<p>Summary : .27 is a number Ruby hates.It&#8217;s a number that marks the percentage of the population that has survived. It&#8217;s a number that means she&#8217;s one of the &#8220;lucky&#8221; few still standing. And it&#8217;s a number that says her father is probably dead.Against all odds, Ruby has survived the catastrophic onset of the killer rain. Two weeks after the radio started broadcasting the warning, &#8220;It&#8217;s in the rain. It&#8217;s fatal and there&#8217;s no cure,&#8221; the drinkable water is running out. Ruby&#8217;s left with two persevere on her own, or embark on a treacherous journey across the country to find her father-if he&#8217;s even still alive.</p>

<p>Summary : It&#8217;s the early 1990s and three young people are looking to change their lives, and perhaps also the world. Attracted to the ambitious global peacekeeping work of the UN, Andrew, Ken and Heidi&#8217;s paths cross in Cambodia, from where their fates are to become inextricably bound. Over the coming years, their stories interweave through countries such as Rwanda, Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti &#8211; war-torn, lawless places where the intervention of the UN is needed like nowhere else. Driven by idealism, the three struggle to do the best they can, caught up in an increasingly tangled web of bureaucracy and ineffectual leadership. As disillusionment sets in, they attempt to keep hold of their humanity through black humour, revelry and &#8217;emergency sex&#8217;.Brutal and moving in equal measure, Emergency Sex (And Other Desperate Measures) explores pressing global issues while never losing a sense of the personal. Deeply critical of the West&#8217;s indifference to developing countries and the UN&#8217;s repeated failure </p>

Over the coming years, their stories interweave through countries such as Rwanda, Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti &#8211; war-torn, lawless places where the intervention of the UN is needed like nowhere else. Driven by idealism, the three struggle to do the best they can, caught up in an increasingly tangled web of bureaucracy and ineffectual leadership. As disillusionment sets in, they attempt to keep hold of their humanity through black humour, revelry and &#8217;emergency sex&#8217;.Brutal and moving in equal measure, Emergency Sex (And Other Desperate Measures) explores pressing global issues while never losing a sense of the personal. Deeply critical of the West&#8217;s indifference to developing countries and the UN&#8217;s repeated failure </p>

But on May 10, 1940, as Nazi tanks approach, this timid, happy man must abandon his home and confront the ?Fate? that he has secretly awaited.

There, he meets Anna, a sad-looking, dark- haired girl, whose accent is ?neither Belgian nor German,? and who ?seemed foreign to everything around her.? As the mystery of Anna?s identity is gradually revealed, Marcel leaps from the heights of an exhilarating freedom to the depths of a terrifying responsibility?one that will lead him to a blood-chilling choice.When it first appeared in English in 1964, British novelist and critic Brigid Brophy declared The Train to be ?the novel his admirers had been expecting all along from Simenon.? Until The Train, she wrote, the dazzlingly </p>

<p>Summary : Al despertar, lo primero que percibimos es el tacto de nuestras s?banas, la luz con la que nos envuelve la l?mpara que encendemos, la forma y color de la vajilla del desayuno&#8230; Desde ese momento y hasta terminar el d?a, cuando cerramos de nuevo los ojos sobre el textil de la almohada, nuestro cuerpo se habr? topado y desenvuelto con una infinidad de objetos diversos. Se trata de cosas modestas, comunes y ordinarias, que usamos constantemente sin prestarles apenas atenci?n. Pero los objetos son tambi?n unos compa?eros constantes en nuestra vida y, como tales, afirma Soetsu Yanagi, deben hacerse con cuidado y fabricarse para que duren. Deben ser tratados con respeto e incluso afecto. Y deben aunar perfectamente belleza y utilidad.Soetsu Yanagi es un pensador imprescindible hasta ahora in?dito en castellano, y una de las voces clave del siglo XX en llamar la atenci?n sobre el valor de los objetos cotidianos y la artesan?a an?nima.

<p>Summary : There are two rules: find a way to use your magic and never reveal it to anyone.Hunting lost books is more than a job; it&#8217;s a way for Barbara to hide her powers in the mundane world of the university library. One misstep and she risks exposure to ruthless necromancers willing to destroy anything supernatural they cannot control. But the prickly new professor in charge of her latest assignment proves more than he seems, and rules are no match for her growing fascination.After years of battling to cage the beast within him, Tobias returns to Prague and the safety of his pack of brothers. But keeping his family safe means never revealing his dual nature, not even to the irresistible research assistant with a nose for rare books.When an enchanted book triggers unpredictable surges in Barbara&#8217;s magic, unleashing his beast may be their only defense against the malevolent spell buried in its pages. Now, a 400-year-old witch&#8217;s revenge threatens to reveal everything they&#8217;ve concealed. Trapped </p>

<p>Summary : In the bitter cold of a Montreal winter, Tempe Brennan is digging for a corpse buried more than a century ago. Although Tempe thrives on such enigmas from the past, it?s a chain of contemporary deaths and disappearances that has seized her attention?and she alone is ideally placed to make a chilling connection among the seemingly unrelated events. At the crime scene, at the morgue, and in the lab, Tempe probes a mystery that sweeps from a deadly Quebec fire to startling discoveries in the Carolinas, and culminates in Montreal with a terrifying showdown?a nerve-shattering test of both her forensic expertise and her skills for survival.</p>

Although Tempe thrives on such enigmas from the past, it?s a chain of contemporary deaths and disappearances that has seized her attention?and she alone is ideally placed to make a chilling connection among the seemingly unrelated events. At the crime scene, at the morgue, and in the lab, Tempe probes a mystery that sweeps from a deadly Quebec fire to startling discoveries in the Carolinas, and culminates in Montreal with a terrifying showdown?a nerve-shattering test of both her forensic expertise and her skills for survival.</p>

The guerrilla campaign that followed was every bit as extraordinary as the six men who directed it. One of them, Cecil Clarke, was a maverick engineer who had spent the 1930s inventing futuristic caravans. Now, his talents were put to more devious use: he built the dirty bomb used to assassinate Hitler&#8217;s favorite, Reinhard Heydrich. Another, William Fairbairn, was a portly pensioner with an unusual passion: he was the world&#8217;s leading expert in silent killing, hired to train the guerrillas being parachuted behind enemy lines. Led by dapper Scotsman Colin Gubbins, these men?along with three others?formed a secret inner circle that, aided by a group of formidable ladies, single-handedly changed the course Second World War: a cohort hand-picked by </p>

<p>Summary : The first definitive biography of the iconic, notoriously private British fashion designer Alexander McQueen explores the connections between his dark work and even darker life.When forty-year-old Alexander McQueen committed suicide in February 2010, a shocked world mourned the loss. McQueen had risen from humble beginnings as the son of an East London taxi driver to scale the heights of fame, fortune, and glamour. He designed clothes for the world&#8217;s most beautiful women and royalty, most famously the Duchess of Cambridge, who wore a McQueen dress on her wedding day. He created a multimillion-dollar luxury brand that became a favorite with celebrities including Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell.But behind the confident facade and bad-boy image, lay a sensitive soul who struggled to survive in the ruthless world of fashion. As the pressures of work intensified, McQueen became increasingly dependent on the drugs that contributed to his tragic end. Meanwhile, in his private life, his failure </p>

El presente estudio analiza un conjunto de cartas, datado entre 1951 y 1970, que establecen el escenario sentimental, laboral y familiar en el que se mov?an las mujeres de la clase trabajadora. Las cartas, que en su mayor?a no se radiaron, constituyeron una v?a de comunicaci?n paralela al programa de radio y se contestaron particularmente, puesto que su contenido exced?a la inocente consulta de belleza para describir graves casos de marginaci?n, malos tratos y frustraci?n personal.

<p>Summary : Venerated for his lyrics, Bob Dylan in fact is a songwriting musician with a unique mastery of merging his words with music and performance. Larry Starr cuts through pretention and myth to provide a refreshingly holistic appreciation of Dylan&#8217;s music. Ranging from celebrated classics to less familiar compositions, Starr invites readers to reinvigorate their listening experiences by sharing his own?sometimes approaching a song from a fresh perspective, sometimes reeling in surprise at discoveries found in well-known favorites. Starr breaks down often-overlooked aspects of the works, from Dylan&#8217;s many vocal styles to his evocative harmonica playing to his choices as a composer. The result is a guide that allows listeners to follow their own passionate love of music into hearing these songs?and personal favorites?in new ways. Reader-friendly and revealing, Listening to Bob Dylan encourages hardcore fans and Dylan-curious seekers alike to rediscover the music legend.</p>

<p>Summary : For millions of moviegoers unable to see the original stage version of &#8220;West Side Story, &#8221; director Robert Wise&#8217;s adaptation was a cinematic gift that brought a Broadway hit to a mass audience. Ernesto Acevedo-Munoz argues that Wise&#8217;s film was not only hugely popular, but that it was also an artistic triumph that marked an important departure in the history of American movie making.With a score by Leonard Bernstein and choreography by Jerome Robbins, this update of the Romeo and Juliet story remains one of the most revered and highly popular American movie musicals, with only &#8220;Singin&#8217; in the Rain&#8221; ranking higher in the AFI&#8217;s list of the best of the genre. Acevedo-Munoz draws on previously unreleased production documents&#8211;from interoffice memos to annotations on the director&#8217;s script&#8211;to go beyond publicity accounts and provide an inside look at this critically acclaimed film classic, offering details of its filming that have never before been published.From location scouting to </p>

<p>Summary : They were inseparable ? until the day they jumped. Ruth, saved by safety nets, leaves the city. Kari, saved by a sewer, crawls back into the fray of the living. She writes ad copy for hair products and ill-fitting lingerie, falls for cats and roadside urchins, and the occasional adventuress in a restaurant. As Danger Chhori, her PVC-suit-clad alter ego, she unclogs sewers and observes the secret lives of people and fruit. And with Angel, Lazarus, and the girls of Crystal Palace forming the chorus to her song, she explores the dark heart of Smog City ? loneliness, sewers, sleeper success, death ? and the memory of her absentee Other. Sensuously illustrated and livened by wry commentaries on life and love, Kari gives a new voice to graphic fiction in India.</p>

<p>Summary : Lucy Barton is a writer, but her ex-husband, William, remains a hard man to read. William, she confesses, has always been a mystery to me. Another mystery is why the two have remained connected after all these years. They just are. So Lucy is both surprised and not surprised when William asks her to join him on a trip to investigate a recently uncovered family secret?one of those secrets that rearrange everything we think we know about the people closest to us. What happens next is nothing less than another example of what Hilary Mantel has called Elizabeth Strout?s ?perfect attunement to the human condition.? There are fears and insecurities, simple joys and acts of tenderness, and revelations about affairs and other spouses, parents and their children.

At the heart of this story is the indomitable voice of Lucy Barton, who offers a profound, lasting </p>

<p>Summary : La ?poca vikinga fue testigo de una expansi?n sin precedentes de los pueblos escandinavos. Comerciantes, piratas, exploradores y colonizadores vikingos viajaron desde Am?rica del Norte hasta las estepas asi?ticas y navegaron por todos los mares. Pero, durante siglos, estos pueblos se nos han presentado a trav?s de una ?ptica distorsionada para satisfacer los gustos de cronistas medievales, dramaturgos isabelinos, potencias imperialistas y muchos otros.En Vikingos: la historia definitiva de los pueblos del norte, el prestigioso historiador Neil Price presenta por primera vez un retrato fidedigno de los vikingos basado en las ?ltimas investigaciones y descubrimientos arqueol?gicos. En un ?pico recorrido que abarca desde la ca?da del Imperio romano al siglo xii, Price rastrea el origen de los vikingos, nos descubre su cultura y cosmolog?a, y explica qu? los impuls? a lanzarse a los saqueos que los hicieron temidos en toda Europa. Price nos muestra a los vikingos tal y como ellos mismos </p>

<p>Summary : The uprising of 2020 marked a new phase in the unfolding Movement for Black Lives. The brutal killings of Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, and Breonna Taylor, and countless other injustices large and small, were the match that lit the spark of the largest protest movement in US history, a historic uprising against racism and the politics of disposability that the Covid-19 pandemic lays bare.In this urgent and incisive collection of new interviews bookended by two new essays, Marc Lamont Hill critically examines the ?pre-existing conditions? that have led us to this moment of crisis and upheaval, guiding us through both the perils and possibilities, and helping us imagine an abolitionist future.</p>

<p>Summary : The uprising of 2020 marked a new phase in the unfolding Movement for Black Lives. The brutal killings of Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, and Breonna Taylor, and countless other injustices large and small, were the match that lit the spark of the largest protest movement in US history, a historic uprising against racism and the politics of disposability that the Covid-19 pandemic lays bare.In this urgent and incisive collection of new interviews bookended by two new essays, Marc Lamont Hill critically examines the ?pre-existing conditions? that have led us to this moment of crisis and upheaval, guiding us through both the perils and possibilities, and helping us imagine an abolitionist future.</p>

<p>Summary : World-renowned Bible translator and commentator George M. Lamsa explains nearly one thousand crucial idioms that will enrich reading of the Old and New Testaments for students and general reader alike.Lamsa, who was raised speaking Aramaic in a community that followed customs largely unchanged since the times of Christ, offers fresh, accurate translations of important idioms, metaphors, and figures of speech found in the Scripture&#8211;and provides clear explanations of their meaning of biblical context.Just as Shakespeare, Milton, and Browning wrote in the vernacular for English-speaking people, Moses the prophets, and the apostles wrote for their own people in the plain language of their times, so that even the unlearned might understand God&#8217;s Word. Over the centuries, inaccurate translations and misunderstandings of customs and concepts have led to difficulties in bringing the biblical message to contemporary English-speaking readers.For example, when a man says to Jesus, &#8220;let me bury </p>

<p>Summary : Andrea wants to submit, but not to just any so-called Dom. He has to be tougher than the slum-bred bullies she grew up with. She?d given up finding a true Dom when her friend finagles her a place as a trainee in an exclusive BDSM club with the powerful Shadowlands Masters. Andrea?s thrilled&#8230;and terrified.Forced to accept an unknown submissive into his carefully run trainee program, Master Cullen is furious. Not only is the young woman new to BDSM, but she?s unsuited to her role&#8211;armoured in leather like a Domme, she?s more liable to punch a Dom than kneel. He decides to push her right back out the door. But as he ruthlessly intimidates her, punishes her, then comforts her, his glimpses of the woman inside the emotional armour intrigue him and her utter surrender captures his heart. Although Master Cullen is famous for his unfettered lifestyle, Andrea believes he might be interested in her, until she discovers he?s not just a bartender&#8211;he?s a cop. Maybe he?d overlook her past brush </p>

<p>Summary : Over twenty years ago, Sven Lindqvist, one of the great pioneers of a new kind of experiential history writing, set out across Central Africa. Obsessed with a single line from Conrad&#8217;s Heart of Darkness &#8211; Kurtz&#8217;s injunction to &#8220;Exterminate all the brutes&#8221; &#8211; he braided an account of his experiences with a profound historical investigation, revealing to the reader with immediacy and cauterizing force precisely what Europe&#8217;s imperial powers had exacted from Africa&#8217;s peoples over the course of the preceding two centuries.Shocking, humane, crackling with imaginative energies and moral purpose, &#8216;Exterminate All the Brutes&#8217; stands as an impassioned, timeless classic. It is essential reading for anybody ready to come to terms with the brutal, racist history on which Europe has built its wealth.</p>

<p>Summary : The childhood of poet Patricia Lockwood was unusual in many respects. There was the location: an impoverished, nuclear waste-riddled area of the American Midwest. There was her mother, a woman who speaks almost entirely in strange riddles and warnings of impending danger. Above all, there was her gun-toting, guitar-riffing, frequently semi-naked father, who underwent a religious conversion on a submarine and found a loophole which saw him approved for the Catholic priesthood by the future Pope Benedict XVI, despite already having a wife and children. When an unexpected crisis forces Lockwood and her husband to move back into her parents&#8217; rectory, she must learn to live again with the family&#8217;s simmering madness, and to reckon with the dark side of her religious upbringing. Pivoting from the raunchy to the sublime, from the comic to the serious, Priestdaddy is an unforgettable story of how we balance tradition against hard-won identity?and of how, having journeyed in the underworld, we </p>

Certi dell?esistenza di un oscuro complotto, molti sostenitori di Trump erano davvero convinti di essere in missione per conto del misterioso QAnon, una gola profonda che attraverso messaggi segreti sparsi su internet cercava di fermare una setta di pedofili sanguinari capeggiata da Hillary Clinton. Ma quante sono le teorie del complotto che abbiamo visto montare in questi ultimi anni? Quanti disegni segreti vengono orditi ogni giorno dietro il paravento di un placido Occidente democratico? E non notate una certa aria di famiglia? I complotti di oggi hanno infatti radici lontanissime e sterminate per chi ? in grado di vederlo c?? un filo invisibile che unisce gli Illuminati di Baviera e l?omicidio Kennedy, gli ufo e la minaccia del 5g, i luciferini gesuiti coi loro Monita Secreta e l?11 settembre, gli untori della peste e l?esercito dei no mask contro la finta </p>

<p>Summary : Il 2021 si ? aperto con una scena migliaia di manifestanti assaltano Capitol Hill per rovesciare l?elezione di Joe Biden. Certi dell?esistenza di un oscuro complotto, molti sostenitori di Trump erano davvero convinti di essere in missione per conto del misterioso QAnon, una gola profonda che attraverso messaggi segreti sparsi su internet cercava di fermare una setta di pedofili sanguinari capeggiata da Hillary Clinton. Ma quante sono le teorie del complotto che abbiamo visto montare in questi ultimi anni? Quanti disegni segreti vengono orditi ogni giorno dietro il paravento di un placido Occidente democratico? E non notate una certa aria di famiglia? I complotti di oggi hanno infatti radici lontanissime e sterminate per chi ? in grado di vederlo c?? un filo invisibile che unisce gli Illuminati di Baviera e l?omicidio Kennedy, gli ufo e la minaccia del 5g, i luciferini gesuiti coi loro Monita Secreta e l?11 settembre, gli untori della peste e l?esercito dei no mask contro la finta </p>

<p>Summary : A dark Chemistry lab. A fake British accent. It&#8217;s all fun and games until somebody falls in love.When sixteen-year-old, Ashlyn Brooks, runs into a sweet British guy in the dark Chemistry lab, she has no idea she&#8217;s actually sitting in the pitch black room with her longtime rival, Luke Davenport. She also doesn&#8217;t know that she&#8217;s stepped into another one of the football captain&#8217;s pranks. It isn&#8217;t long before she&#8217;s sharing things she&#8217;s never told anyone, and starting to fall for the mysterious guy with a sexy accent who seems to understand her in a way no one ever has before.When Luke&#8217;s mom dies the summer before his senior year, he turns to pranking Ashlyn to keep his mind off his loss. But the more he gets to know her, the more he regrets using his fake British accent in the first place. Soon Luke is walking the thin line of keeping his lies a secret and wishing he could tell her that the boy she&#8217;s falling for is really him.Meet Me There is a standalone novel in The Ridgewater High </p>

Nichols PDF Visit Link Bellow You Can Download or Read Book online for free Visit Here : https://goodslibrary.com/?book=0043258871 Summary : Seberapa pentingkah vaksinasi? Benarkah Bumi itu datar? Apakah telur baik untuk dikonsumsi? Pada era informasi seperti sekarang, yang menjawab pertanyaan-pertanyaan semacam itu bukan hanya pakar, melainkan juga para penganut teori konspirasi, orang awam sok tahu, hingga pesohor yang menyesatkan. Kadang, dalam rimba informasi masa kini, penjelasan pakar tidak didengar, sementara jawaban dari tokoh yang mempunyai banyak pengikut justru lebih dipercaya dan membahayakan banyak orang.Tom Nichols memotret dengan baik realitas tersebut. Menggunakan istilah ?matinya kepakaran?, profesor U.S. Naval War College dan Harvard Extension School itu menunjukkan bagaimana pendapat yang salah bisa dianggap sebagai kebenaran. Parahnya, pihak-pihak yang seharusnya memberikan pencerahan, seperti perguruan tinggi, media, hingga kalangan pakar itu sendiri, kadang justru memiliki andil dalam membunuh kepakaran.Matinya Kepakaran adalah pesan agar semua orang mencari dan memperoleh informasi dari sumber yang Discover the Bestseller Everyone is Talking About: Read Matinya Kepakaran &amp;#8211; The Death of Expertise PDF , Reading Matinya Kepakaran &amp;#8211; The Death of Expertise pdf , Matinya Kepakaran &amp;#8211; The Death of Expertise Handbook , Matinya Kepakaran &amp;#8211; The Death of Expertise read , Matinya Kepakaran &amp;#8211; The Death of Expertise epub , Matinya Kepakaran &amp;#8211; The Death of Expertise in English , Matinya Kepakaran &amp;#8211; The Death of Expertise Kindle , Matinya Kepakaran &amp;#8211; The Death of Expertise audiobook Matinya Kepakaran &amp;#8211; The Death of Expertise Summary.

<p>Summary : Gwyn Jones is perfectly happy with her life in Graves Glen. She, her mom, and her cousin have formed a new and powerful coven; she&#8217;s running a successful witchcraft shop, Something Wicked; and she&#8217;s started mentoring some of the younger witches in town. As Halloween approaches, there&#8217;s only one problem &#8211; Llewellyn &#8220;Wells&#8221; Penhallow. Wells has come to Graves Glen to re-establish his family&#8217;s connection to the town they founded as well as to make a new life for himself after years of being the dutiful son in Wales. When he opens up a shop of his own, Penhallow&#8217;s, just across the street from Something Wicked, he quickly learns he&#8217;s gotten more than he bargained for in going up against Gwyn. When their professional competition leads to a very personal &#8211; and very hot &#8211; kiss, both Wells and Gwyn are determined to stay away from each other, convinced the kiss was just a magical fluke. But when a mysterious new coven of witches come to town and Gwyn&#8217;s powers begin fading, she and Wells must </p>

<p>Summary : WOULD YOU KILL ONE PERSON TO SAVE FIVE OTHERS?If you could upload all of your memories into a machine, would that machine be you? Is it possible we&#8217;re all already artificial intelligences, living inside a simulation?These sound like questions from a philosophy class, but in fact they&#8217;re from modern, popular video games. Philosophical discussion often uses thought experiments to consider ideas that we can&#8217;t test in real life, and media like books, films, and games can make these thought experiments far more accessible to a non-academic audience. Thanks to their interactive nature, video games can be especially effective ways to explore these ideas.Each chapter of this book introduces a philosophical topic through discussion of relevant video games, with interviews with game creators and expert philosophers.
