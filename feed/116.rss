<p>Summary : A new action-packed spy and adventure series for young fans of Alex Rider and Jason Bourne&#8211;with the first four books publishing simultaneously. Binge read for summer! Following on the heels of the edge-of-your-seat cliffhanger conclusion of Recruit (BODYGUARD book 1), the action resumes inHostageas teenage martial arts expert and trained bodyguard Connor Reeves struggles to complete his first mission and protect the U.S. President&#8217;s daughter, Alicia, from danger . . . even if it means putting his life on the line. Despite the safety net surrounding Alicia, Connor is her last line of defense&#8211;but that fact is a secret. As far as the president&#8217;s daughter knows, he&#8217;s nothing more than the visiting son of a diplomat&#8211;and possible date to the school dance&#8211;which makes it difficult for Connor to effectively carry out his duty. Yet danger waits for no one and the terrorist plot to kidnap Alicia is already under way, the gears turning in total secrecy, as the enemy prepares to strike. </p>

<p>Summary : Whether it is the effects of climate change, the avalanche of electronic and plastic waste or the substandard living and working conditions of billions of our fellow global citizens, our ability to deal with unsustainability will define the 21st Century.

<p>Summary : In the history of philosophy, few topics are so relevant to today&#8217;s cultural and political landscape as philosophy in the Islamic world. Yet, this remains one of the lesser-known philosophical traditions. In this Very Short Introduction, Peter Adamson explores the history of philosophy among Muslims, Jews, and Christians living in Islamic lands, from its historical background to thinkers in the twentieth century. Introducing the main philosophical themes of the Islamic world, Adamson integrates ideas from the Islamic and Abrahamic faiths to consider the broad philosophical questions that continue to invite debate: What is the relationship between reason and religious belief? What is the possibility of proving God&#8217;s existence? What is the nature of knowledge? Drawing on the most recent research in the field, this book challenges the assumption of the cultural decline of philosophy and science in the Islamic world by demonstrating its rich heritage and overlap with other faiths and </p>

<p>Summary : Outdoor educator and field researcher Sara Dykman made history when she became the first person to bicycle along?side monarch butterflies on their storied annual migration?a round-trip adventure that included three countries and more than 10,000 miles. She did it solo, on a bike cobbled together from used parts. Her panniers were recycled buckets. ? In Bicycling with Butterflies, Dykman recounts her journey and the ups and downs of the nearly nine-month odyssey. We?re beside her as she nav?igates unmapped roads in foreign countries, checks roadside milkweed for monarch eggs, and shares her passion with eager schoolchil?dren, skeptical bar patrons, and unimpressed border officials. We also meet some of the ardent monarch stewards who supported her efforts, from citizen scientists and research?ers to farmers and high-rise city dwellers.</p>

<p>Summary : Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, the son of a little-educated boat-owner in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, had an unparalleled career as a defence scientist, culminating in the highest civilian award of India, the Bharat Ratna. As chief of the country&#8217;s defence research and development programme, Kalam demonstrated the great potential for dynamism and innovation that existed in seemingly moribund research establishments. This is the story of Kalam&#8217;s rise from obscurity and his personal and professional struggles, as well as the story of Agni, Prithvi, Akash, Trishul and Nag-missiles that have become household names in India and that have raised the nation to the level of a missile power of international reckoning. This is also the saga of independent India&#8217;s struggle for technological self-sufficiency and defensive autonomy-a story as much about politics, domestic and international, as it is about science.</p>

<p>Summary : People with BPD can be compassionate, caring, smart, and funny, but they are also prone to explosive emotional outbursts and highly self-destructive acts. BPD expert Dr. Shari Manning helps overwhelmed loved ones understand why their spouse, adult child, or other family member acts so &#8220;impossible&#8221;?and learn to respond differently.

<p>Summary : The rite has existed for as long as anyone can remember: when the prince-who-will-be-king comes of age, he must venture out into the gray lands, slay a fierce dragon, and rescue a damsel to be his bride. This is the way things have always been.When Ama wakes in the arms of Prince Emory, however, she knows none of this. She has no memory of what came before she was captured by the dragon, or what horrors she has faced in its lair. She knows only this handsome prince, the story he tells of her rescue, and her destiny to sit on the throne beside him. Ama comes with Emory back to the kingdom of Harding, hailed as the new princess, welcomed to the court.However, as soon as her first night falls, she begins to realize that not all is as it seems, that there is more to the legends of the dragons and the damsels than anyone knows?and that the greatest threats to her life may not be behind her, but here, in front of her.</p>

<p>Summary : The rite has existed for as long as anyone can remember: when the prince-who-will-be-king comes of age, he must venture out into the gray lands, slay a fierce dragon, and rescue a damsel to be his bride. This is the way things have always been.When Ama wakes in the arms of Prince Emory, however, she knows none of this. She has no memory of what came before she was captured by the dragon, or what horrors she has faced in its lair. She knows only this handsome prince, the story he tells of her rescue, and her destiny to sit on the throne beside him. Ama comes with Emory back to the kingdom of Harding, hailed as the new princess, welcomed to the court.However, as soon as her first night falls, she begins to realize that not all is as it seems, that there is more to the legends of the dragons and the damsels than anyone knows?and that the greatest threats to her life may not be behind her, but here, in front of her.</p>

<p>Summary : This blistering debut by &#8220;perhaps the best writer of Arabic fiction alive? (The Guardian)is the first major literary work about the Iraq War from an Iraqi perspective. Showing us the war as we have never seen it before, here is a world not only of soldiers and assassins, hostages and car bombers, refugees and terrorists, but also of madmen and prophets, angels and djinni, sorcerers and spirits. Blending shocking realism with flights of fantasy, The Corpse Exhibition offers us a pageant of horrors, as haunting as the photos of Abu Ghraib and as difficult to look away from, but shot through with a gallows humor that yields an unflinching comedy of the macabre. Gripping and hallucinatory, this is a new kind of storytelling forged in the crucible of war.</p>

<p>Summary : There?s a war raging, and I?m caught in the middle.My father has had a run in with the New York brotherhood, and one of the New York brotherhood spies takes me.Lyov is muscle bound, tattooed, and gorgeous.He is also quiet and brooding.He won?t speak to me.He barely looks at me.The rare occasions I do catch his eyes on me, they?re burning with dark desire.I have to escape, otherwise I?ll end up as collateral damage.So, why do I want to stay?Even more so when he touches me.I can?t ignore the way this man makes me feel.We?re from two opposing sides, and I know it can?t work.Our attraction could lead to destruction, but my heart doesn&#8217;t want to give up.Captured is the second book in the New York Brotherhood Series. It&#8217;s a story with no cliffhangers, a HEA and no cheating. This story has hot scenes, some dark themes, and bad language. Like most of the books by Bianca Cole it features an over the top possessive alpha male. * originally published as Captured by the Bratva.</p>

I think I?m in love with my bodyguard.Leo Mason is all I?ve been able to think about since he broke my heart and left me standing alone on my front porch six months ago.But now he?s back.

As a bodyguard with Redleg Security and a former Army Ranger, I?ve got lots of secrets and even more enemies.Six months ago, I did the unthinkable when I fell for a woman I was protecting.She?s too young for me ? too innocent ? and being with me comes at a cost. One I didn?t want her to be forced to pay.So I did the best thing I could do to save her ? I left.But now </p>

<p>Summary : A teen girl disappears from her small town deep in the bayou, where magic festers beneath the surface of the swamp like water rot, in this chilling debut supernatural thriller for fans of Natasha Preston, Karen McManus, and Rory Power.La Cachette, Louisiana, is the worst place to be if you have something to hide.This tiny town, where seventeen-year-old Grey spends her summers, is the self-proclaimed Psychic Capital of the World&#8211;and the place where Elora Pellerin, Grey&#8217;s best friend, disappeared six months earlier.Grey can&#8217;t believe that Elora vanished into thin air any more than she can believe that nobody in a town full of psychics knows what happened. But as she digs into the night that Elora went missing, she begins to realize that everybody in town is hiding something &#8211; her grandmother Honey; her childhood crush Hart; and even her late mother, whose secrets continue to call to Grey from beyond the grave.When a mysterious stranger emerges from the bayou &#8211; a stormy-eyed boy with </p>

<p>Summary : These feelings are utterly wrong. He must be an impostor.The last time Liam Blake saw his eldest brother, Liam was five and Anthony was sixteen. Liam barely remembers him. He remembers adoring him and remembers missing him, but his childhood memories faded as he grew up. Fifteen years later, a man who calls himself Anthony Blake finally comes home after the war ends. He has documents that prove his identity, and he has Anthony?s dark hair, blue eyes, and broad shoulders. There?s no reason to think he isn?t who he says he is?except for Liam?s strange, inexplicable attraction to the man who claims to be Anthony. Liam refuses to believe he?s that sick: related alphas and omegas can?t be drawn to each other or get fixated on their sibling?s scent. It?s unnatural. It?s perverse. Could that man be an impostor? But if he is, who is he?and why is he pretending to be Anthony Blake?</p>

There?s no reason to think he isn?t who he says he is?except for Liam?s strange, inexplicable attraction to the man who claims to be Anthony. Liam refuses to believe he?s that sick: related alphas and omegas can?t be drawn to each other or get fixated on their sibling?s scent. It?s unnatural. It?s perverse. Could that man be an impostor? But if he is, who is he?and why is he pretending to be Anthony Blake?</p>

<p>Summary : TARAII was supposed to be in charge. That was always my intention.Until that slick corporate raider, Ethan Bradford, clicked his fancy pen and poof! Just like that, I was under him, instead of on top.Rich and powerful men-especially arrogant, handsome ones-are all the same.I know exactly how to handle him, but when my father pulls rank and orders me to play nice, my plans of putting him in his place vanish.I know his type. I&#8217;ve been around men like him my entire life, but one chance meeting with him and his son, makes me question everything I thought I knew.ETHANWhen it comes to business, I always come out on top. Not even being a single dad can slow me down. I never let a good investment get away, and that includes Taylor Toys. After all, business is business, right?How was I supposed to know a friendly meeting would set me on fire? Tara Taylor is a spoiled princess, used to getting everything she wants.Sure, her good looks and smart mouth turn me on like nothing else. Despite her </p>

<p>Summary : Cybernetics (loosely translated from the Greek): ?a helmsman who steers his ship to port.? Psycho-Cybernetics is a?term coined by Dr. Maxwell Maltz, which means, ?steering your mind to a productive, useful goal so you can reach the?greatest port in the world, peace of mind.?Since its first publication in 1960, Maltz?s landmark bestseller has inspired and enhanced the lives of more than 30 million readers. In this updated edition, with a new introduction and editorial commentary by Matt Furey, president of the Psycho-Cybernetics Foundation, the original text has been annotated and amplified to make Maltz?s message even?more relevant for the contemporary reader.?Before the mind can work efficiently, we must develop our perception of the outcomes we expect to reach. Maxwell Maltz calls this Psycho-Cybernetics; when the mind has a defined target it can focus and direct and refocus and?redirect until it reaches its intended goal.? ?Tony Robbins (from Unlimited Power)Maltz was the first </p>

<p>Summary : It&#8217;s the end of World War II. FDR&#8217;s New Deal has redefined American politics. Taxes are at an all-time high. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki has brought a fear of total annihilation. The rise of secret government agencies and sanctions on business has many watching their backs. America&#8217;s sense of freedom is diminishing . . . and many are desperate to take that freedom back.Among them is a great dreamer, an immigrant who pulled himself from the depths of poverty to become one of the wealthiest and admired men in the world. That man is Andrew Ryan, and he believed that great men and women deserve better. And so he set out to create the impossible, a utopia free from government, censorship, and moral restrictions on science&#8211;where what you give is what you get. He created Rapture&#8212;the shining city below the sea.But as we all know, this utopia suffered a great tragedy. This is the story of how it all came to be . . .and how it all ended.</p>

And so he set out to create the impossible, a utopia free from government, censorship, and moral restrictions on science&#8211;where what you give is what you get. He created Rapture&#8212;the shining city below the sea.But as we all know, this utopia suffered a great tragedy. This is the story of how it all came to be . . .and how it all ended.</p>

<p>Summary : The gospel of Jesus Christ is not about what Jesus can do for your life. It is not even the answer to the question, ?How can I be saved?? It is the declaration of a victory. In His coming to earth, His suffering, and His Resurrection, Christ conquered demons, sin, and death. In Arise, O God , author and podcaster Fr. Andrew Stephen Damick introduces us to the spiritual war that Christ won by His victory, how we are caught in that war?s cosmic crossfire, what the true content of the gospel is &#8211; and how we are to respond.</p>

<p>Summary : Peter Frankopan lehrt uns, die Geschichte neu zu sehen ? indem er nicht Europa, sondern den Nahen und Mittleren Osten zum Ausgangspunkt macht. Hier entstanden die ersten Hochkulturen und alle drei monotheistischen Weltreligionen; ein Reichtum an G?tern, Kultur und Wissen, der das Alte Europa seit jeher sehns?chtig nach Osten blicken lie?. Frankopan erz?hlt von Alexander dem Gro?en, der Babylon zur Hauptstadt seines neuen Weltreichs machen wollte; von Seide, Porzellan und Techniken wie der Papierherstellung, die ?ber die Handelswege der Region Verbreitung fanden; vom Sklavenhandel mit der islamischen Welt, der Venedig im Mittelalter zum Aufstieg verhalf; von islamischen Gelehrten, die das antike Kulturerbe pflegten, lange bevor Europa die Renaissance erlebte; von der Erschlie?ung der Rohstoffe im 19. Jahrhundert bis hin zum Nahostkonflikt. Schlie?lich erkl?rt Frankopan, warum sich die Weltpolitik noch heute in Staaten wie Syrien, Afghanistan und Irak entscheidet.Peter Frankopan </p>

<p>Summary : Peter Frankopan lehrt uns, die Geschichte neu zu sehen ? indem er nicht Europa, sondern den Nahen und Mittleren Osten zum Ausgangspunkt macht. Hier entstanden die ersten Hochkulturen und alle drei monotheistischen Weltreligionen; ein Reichtum an G?tern, Kultur und Wissen, der das Alte Europa seit jeher sehns?chtig nach Osten blicken lie?. Frankopan erz?hlt von Alexander dem Gro?en, der Babylon zur Hauptstadt seines neuen Weltreichs machen wollte; von Seide, Porzellan und Techniken wie der Papierherstellung, die ?ber die Handelswege der Region Verbreitung fanden; vom Sklavenhandel mit der islamischen Welt, der Venedig im Mittelalter zum Aufstieg verhalf; von islamischen Gelehrten, die das antike Kulturerbe pflegten, lange bevor Europa die Renaissance erlebte; von der Erschlie?ung der Rohstoffe im 19. Jahrhundert bis hin zum Nahostkonflikt. Schlie?lich erkl?rt Frankopan, warum sich die Weltpolitik noch heute in Staaten wie Syrien, Afghanistan und Irak entscheidet.Peter Frankopan </p>

Hasta que se produce el descubrimiento del Flujo, un campo extradimensional que se encuentra en ciertos puntos del espacio-tiempo y que puede transportarnos a planetas de otros sistemas solares.A trav?s del Flujo, la humanidad se expande a nuevos planetas. La Tierra cae en el olvido y se erige un nuevo imperio, la Interdependencia, fundamentado en el principio de que ning?n asentamiento humano puede sobrevivir sin los dem?s. Es una manera de evitar las guerras interestelares? y, para los gobernantes del imperio, un sistema de control.El Flujo es eterno, pero no es est?tico.

<p>Summary : It?s the summer of 1955. For Ethan Harper, a biracial kid raised mostly by his white father, race has always been a distant conversation. When he?s sent to spend the summer with his aunt and uncle in small-town Alabama, his Blackness is suddenly front and center, and no one is shy about making it known he?s not welcome there. Except for Juniper Jones. The town?s resident oddball and free spirit, she?s everything the townspeople aren?t?open, kind, and full of acceptance.Armed with two bikes and an unlimited supply of root beer floats, Ethan and Juniper set out to find their place in a town that?s bent on rejecting them. As Ethan is confronted for the first time by what it means to be Black in America, Juniper tries to help him see the beauty in even the ugliest reality, and that even the darkest days can give rise to an invincible summer.Daven McQueen?s Juniper Jones is a character for all ages in this sweet coming of age story set in 1950s Alabama.</p>

<p>Summary : Stephen Baxter&#8217;s highly acclaimed first novel and the beginning of his stunning Xeelee Sequence finally enters the SF Masterwork series!A spaceship from Earth accidentally crossed through a hole in space-time to a universe where the force of gravity is one billion times as strong as the gravity we know. Somehow the crew survived, aided by the fact that they emerged into a cloud of gas surrounding a black hole, which provided a breathable atmosphere.Five hundred years later, their descendants still struggle for existence, divided into two main groups. The Miners live on the Belt, a ramshackle ring of dwellings orbiting the core of a dead star, which they excavate for raw materials. These can be traded for food from the Raft, a structure built from the wreckage of the ship, on which a small group of scientists preserve the ancient knowledge which makes survival possible.Rees is a Miner whose curiosity about his world makes him stow away on a flying tree &#8211; just one of the many strange </p>

<p>Summary : When Heather Shepherd is called to the scene of a murder in Delightful Donuts, her rival&#8217;s donut store, she?s concerned.  It?s the second time something like this has happened in the presence of Geoff Lawless, after all, and her concern turns to shock when she realizes that the murder weapon is a rock hard fudge ball of Geoff?s own making. There?s just one problem: Geoff Lawless is missing, and he?s not the only suspect in this botched batch of a case. Armed with her inquisitive mind, a few boxes of her Coffee Treacle Donuts, and a little help from her friends, Heather hurries down the trails of donut crumb clues to get to the truth.  Heather has to figure out whodunit and fast before the killer gets away or worse, manages to lob another rock hard fudgy treat at an unsuspecting victim.</p>

<p>Summary : Robert E. Howard is famous for creating such immortal heroes as Conan the Cimmerian, Solomon Kane, and Bran Mak Morn. Less well-known but equally extraordinary are his non-fantasy adventure stories set in the Middle East and featuring such two-fisted heroes as Francis Xavier Gordon?known as ?El Borak??Kirby O?Donnell, and Steve Clarney. This trio of hard-fighting Americans, civilized men with more than a touch of the primordial in their veins, marked a new direction for Howard?s writing, and new territory for his genius to conquer.The wily Texan El Borak, a hardened fighter who stalks the sandscapes of Afghanistan like a vengeful wolf, is rivaled among Howard?s creations only by Conan himself. In such classic tales as ?The Daughter of Erlik Khan,? ?Three-Bladed Doom,? and ?Sons of the Hawk,? Howard proves himself once again a master of action, and with plenty of eerie atmosphere his plotting becomes tighter and twistier than ever, resulting in stories worthy of comparison to Jack </p>

<p>Summary : Wicked men stole the boy she loved. But when she found him again, he&#8217;d become more wicked than them all.Malin Strom has been searching for Kase, her childhood sweetheart, since he was lost at the annual masquerade years ago.With her gift for stealing memories, Malin crosses more than one dangerous line to take secrets from those who know what goes on behind the curtain of the wicked festival.But when her brother is traded into the masquerade as punishment for using magic to hide Malin?s gift, her only chance to save him is to enlist the services of a brutal crook?the Nightrender?and he bears a striking resemblance to a face from the past.No longer the boy she knew, her lost love, Kase, now rules as the amoral leader of brutal thieves. Pulled into his world of tricks and schemes, tantalizing attraction returns, but so do the secrets behind Kase?s disappearance, and the masquerade.When their plan to save Malin?s brother takes them back to the dangers of the festival, painful betrayal </p>

<p>Summary : Behind every great revolution is a vision, and behind perhaps the greatest revolution of our time, personal computing, is the vision of J.C.R. Licklider. He did not design the first personal computers or write the software that ran on them, nor was he involved in the legendary early companies that brought them to the forefront of our everyday experience. He was instead a relentless visionary who saw the potential of the way individuals could interact with computers and software. At a time when computers were a short step removed from mechanical data processors, Licklider was writing treatises on &#8220;human-computer symbiosis&#8221;, &#8220;computers as communication devices&#8221;, and a now not-so-unfamiliar &#8220;Intergalactic Network&#8221;. His ideas became so influential, his passion so contagious, that Waldrop called him &#8220;computing&#8217;s Johnny Appleseed&#8221;. In a simultaneously compelling personal narrative and comprehensive historical exposition, Waldrop tells the story of the man who not only instigated the work </p>

<p>Summary : Pers?fone es la diosa de la primavera, aunque solo de nombre porque la realidad es que, desde que puede recordar, las flores se marchitan bajo su toque. Ante la incapacidad de usar sus poderes de diosa, decide mudarse a Nueva Atenas disfrazada como una periodista mortal con la intenci?n de llevar una vida sin complicaciones.Hades, dios de los muertos, posee un gran imperio del juego en el mundo de los mortales. Entre picas y corazones, los rumores se hacen o?r y afirman que sus apuestas favoritas son aquellas imposibles de ganar.Un fortuito encuentro entre Pers?fone y Hades atrapa a la diosa en un contrato de t?rminos imposibles: debe crear vida en el Inframundo o perder? su libertad para siempre. Pero la apuesta har? algo m?s que exponer el fracaso de Pers?fone como diosa. Al tiempo que las semillas de su libertad se esfuerzan por florecer, sus sentimientos hacia Hades crecen sin poder evitarlo, a pesar de saber que est?n? prohibidos.</p>

<p>Summary : In this gorgeously written and authentic novel, Ver?nica, a Peruvian-American teen with hip dysplasia, auditions to become a mermaid at a Central Florida theme park in the summer before her senior year, all while figuring out her first real boyfriend and how to feel safe in her own body.Ver?nica has had many surgeries to manage her disability. The best form of rehabilitation is swimming, so she spends hours in the pool, but not just to strengthen her body.Her Florida town is home to Mermaid Cove, a kitschy underwater attraction where professional mermaids perform in giant tanks . . . and Ver?nica wants to audition. But her conservative Peruvian parents would never go for it. And they definitely would never let her be with Alex, her cute new neighbor.She decides it?s time to seize control of her life, but her plans come crashing down when she learns her parents have been hiding the truth from her?the truth about her own body.</p>

<p>Summary : An original, imaginative, and hilarious debut novel about love, anxiety, and sea creatures, from the author of So Sad Today.Lucy has been writing her dissertation about Sappho for thirteen years when she and Jamie break up. After she hits rock bottom in Phoenix, her Los Angeles-based sister insists Lucy housesit for the summer?her only tasks caring for a beloved diabetic dog and trying to learn to care for herself. Annika?s home is a gorgeous glass cube atop Venice Beach, but Lucy can find no peace from her misery and anxiety?not in her love addiction group therapy meetings, not in frequent Tinder meetups, not in Dominic the foxhound?s easy affection, not in ruminating on the ancient Greeks. Yet everything changes when Lucy becomes entranced by an eerily attractive swimmer one night while sitting alone on the beach rocks.Whip-smart, neurotically funny, sexy, and above all, fearless, The Pisces is built on a premise both sirenic and incredibly real?what happens when you think love </p>

<p>Summary : Sweating may be one of our weirdest biological functions, but it?s also one of our most vital and least understood. In The Joy of Sweat, Sarah Everts delves into its role in the body?and in human history.Why is sweat salty? Why do we sweat when stressed? Why do some people produce colorful sweat? And should we worry about Big Brother tracking the hundreds of molecules that leak out in our sweat?not just the stinky ones or alleged pheromones?but the ones that reveal secrets about our health and vices?Everts?s entertaining investigation takes readers around the world?from Moscow, where she participates in a dating event in which people sniff sweat in search of love, to New Jersey, where companies hire trained armpit sniffers to assess the efficacy of their anti-sweat products. In Finland, Everts explores the delights of the legendary smoke sauna and the purported health benefits of good sweat, while in the Netherlands she slips into the sauna theater scene, replete with costumes, </p>

<p>Summary : A second chance for romance&#8230;Hidden in Graystone Manor is a book containing all the dark secrets of Harmony Harbor, and Ava DiRossi is determined to find it. No one-especially not her ex-husband, Griffin Gallagher-can ever discover what really tore her life apart all those years ago. With Griffin back in town, it&#8217;s more important than ever that she find the book before someone else does. Because her ex is still angry with her for leaving him. And he still has no idea Ava never stopped loving him&#8230;Ava is no longer the vibrant, happy woman Griffin had once loved and married, and he would do anything to bring back the sparkle to her brilliant green eyes. But what&#8217;s never changed are the sexy sparks of attraction between Ava and Griffin, and he won&#8217;t give her up again without a fight. He knows there&#8217;s the real possibility of a future together&#8230; if the truth doesn&#8217;t burn the bridge between them forever.</p>

<p>Summary : Food writer, cooking instructor and author Christopher Tan is back with the definitive book on Singapore?s kueh, sharing everything you need to know about local kueh culture.Much more than just a collection of recipes, The Way of Kueh delves into the topic with a lyrical, insightful and practical approach. It traverses kueh families and genres, key kueh-making techniques, the seasonality and social significance of kueh, and the importance of both tradition and innovation. Local kueh artisans from all walks of life share their stories and perspectives in interviews, while short essays muse on the histories, regional and colonial influences, science and symbolism behind this most diverse of food genres.Helpful glossaries on key ingredients and essential kitchen tools will equip you to tackle over 100 detailed and precise recipes for kuehs from across Singapore?s communities, from ang koo kueh to kueh bakar, kueh kaswi to jian dui, steamed and baked kueh lapis varieties, and many more, </p>

<p>Summary : Near the end of World War II, during the Battle of The Bulge, a US Army unit pursues a renegade SS panzer battalion into the secluded Ardennes forest. There, hidden deep in the snow-covered pines, they find an ancient manor house containing an inhuman evil that defies any sense of reality.Confronted with a supernatural evil inside the manor, and surrounded by enemy troops outside, the soldiers will have to unravel the mysteries of the creature called The Geist and face a nightmarish battle for body and soul if they are to survive.Part war story, part Lovecraftian horror story, One Last Gasp will hold you in its haunting grip from its explosive beginning to its mindbending conclusion.</p>

<p>Summary : C. G. Jung emphasized the deep link to the physical world that exists for the collective unconscious and its archetypes. Our dreams and symbols, as well as the patterns of our behavior, are shaped by the fact that we are creatures of a material universe. Michael Conforti&#8217;s research has been directed to understanding the nature of these links and patterns in the light of the new sciences-quantum theory, chaos theory, self-organization, and the new biology. Conforti&#8217;s book successfully integrates this material to offer a new, exciting challenge to psychotherapy. It demonstrates that the study of consciousness cannot neglect the insights of the sciences and in doing so promises a unified view of mind and matter.</p>

<p>Summary : English is?one of the most complicated languages to learn, and its constantly evolving vocabulary certainly doesn?t help matters. For centuries, men and women have striven to chronicle and categorize the expressions of the English language, and Samuel Johnson is usually thought to be their original predecessor. But that lineage is wrong: Robert Cawdrey published his Table Alphabeticall in 1604, 149 years before Johnson?s tome, and it is now republished here for the first time in over 350 years.??????????? This edition, prepared from the sole surviving copy of the first printing, documents Cawdrey?s fascinating selection of 2,543 words and their first-ever definitions. Cawdrey subtitled his dictionary ?for the benefit of Ladies, Gentlewomen, and other unskilled folk,? for his aim was not to create a comprehensive catalog, but rather an in-depth guide for the lesser educated who might not know the ?hard usual English wordes, borrowed from the Hebrew, Greeke, Latine, or French.?

<p>Summary : Introduction to Number Theory is dedicated to concrete questions about integers, to place an emphasis on problem solving by students. When undertaking a first course in number theory, students enjoy actively engaging with the properties and relationships of numbers.The book begins with introductory material, including uniqueness of factorization of integers and polynomials. Subsequent topics explore quadratic reciprocity, Hensel&#8217;s Lemma, p-adic powers series such as exp(px) and log(1+px), the Euclidean property of some quadratic rings, representation of integers as norms from quadratic rings, and Pell&#8217;s equation via continued fractions.Throughout the five chapters and more than 100 exercises and solutions, readers gain the advantage of a number theory book that focuses on doing calculations. This textbook is a valuable resource for undergraduates or those with a background in university level mathematics.Readership: Students and educators in a university course on number theory.</p>

<p>Summary : Bill Gates&#8217;s Five Books for Summer Reading 2019From world-renowned economist Paul Collier, a candid diagnosis of the failures of capitalism and a pragmatic and realistic vision for how we can repair it.Deep new rifts are tearing apart the fabric of the United States and other Western societies: thriving cities versus rural counties, the highly skilled elite versus the less educated, wealthy versus developing countries. As these divides deepen, we have lost the sense of ethical obligation to others that was crucial to the rise of post-war social democracy. So far these rifts have been answered only by the revivalist ideologies of populism and socialism, leading to the seismic upheavals of Trump, Brexit, and the return of the far-right in Germany. We have heard many critiques of capitalism but no one has laid out a realistic way to fix it, until now.In a passionate and polemical book, celebrated economist Paul Collier outlines brilliantly original and ethical ways of healing these </p>

<p>Summary : I&#8217;d never known true darkness until the lights went out.I had never known what it was to be hungry.Everyone I ever knew was dead. If they weren&#8217;t, then they wished they were.I know I did.Prue Ashford has been surviving alone in the Australian bush for the last three years. After an unknown virus wiped out most of the human population, she escaped the chaos and hid. Every town and city was locked down into quarantine, but that only led to the inevitable. Death.Living off the land, avoiding other survivors turned bad, she&#8217;s led a lonely life, surviving on the edge of a very narrow cliff. The moment she begins to lose hope is when she meets the handsome and enigmatic, Shaw.He&#8217;s the first human being she&#8217;s seen in three years that hasn&#8217;t tried to kill her and she doesn&#8217;t dare to hope. She&#8217;d given up finding anyone alive that still had goodness inside of them.Her only option if she wants to live is to trust Shaw and he takes her to the isolated community he calls home. Being among people </p>

<p>Summary : The first book of its kind, a collection bringing together leading Black scholars and experts for a policy-oriented approach to the fight for racial justice in America.From ongoing reports of police brutality to the disproportionate impact COVID-19 has had on Black Americans, the year 2020 brought a renewed awareness to the deep-rootedness of racism and white supremacy in every facet of American life. As people have looked both inward and to their communities to understand the impact of systemic oppression, they have turned in droves to books for guidance in working toward a more just and equitable world. Until now, however, there has yet to be a book published for a general audience from the perspective of Black scholars and experts proposing ideas from a policy-oriented standpoint.The Black Agenda: Bold Solutions for a Broken System features Black voices across economics, education, health, climate, and technology, speaking to the question &#8220;What&#8217;s next?&#8221; as it pertains to centering </p>

<p>Summary : Miri thinks she has got her wife back, when Leah finally returns after a deep-sea mission that ended in catastrophe. It soon becomes clear, though, that Leah is not the same. Whatever happened in that vessel, whatever it was they were supposed to be studying before they were stranded on the ocean floor, Leah has brought part of it back with her, onto dry land and into their home.Moving through something that only resembles normal life, Miri comes to realize that the life that they had before might be gone. Though Leah is still there, Miri can feel the woman she loves slipping from her grasp.Our Wives Under The Sea is the debut novel from Julia Armfield, the critically acclaimed author of salt slow. It?s a story of falling in love, loss, grief, and what life there is in the deep deep sea.</p>

Fragile.She was a light in the darkness of my life.Back then, she was always meant to be mine, even if having her meant breaking every single rule.Now enemies or not, she would still be mine.</p>

<p>Summary : 21 hrs and 1 min King Midas made me the woman I am today. Notorious. Unattainable. His.The thing about being confined is that you believe it?s to keep the bad out&#8230; Until you realize it?s about keeping you in.I?m now in a strange kingdom surrounded by liars, with no allies of my own, but I won?t sit idly by and let myself wither. No, there?s something that?s bloomed from the pit of my repression. Something dark. Something angry.But the last thing I expected was for my anger to call out to him. King Ravinger.He?s sinister and powerful and entirely too seductive. I?ve learned my lesson with trusting manipulative kings, so why does my chest constrict every time he?s near? I need to tread carefully, or I?m at risk of losing much more than just my freedom.Regret and revenge war inside of me, and I need to figure out a plan fast before I get tangled up in the schemes of kings and queens.Because I won?t be caught in a cage again. No, this time, It?ll be me setting the trap&#8230; I just hope </p>

<p>Summary : From World Fantasy Award-winning author Fonda Lee comes Untethered Sky, an epic fantasy fable about the pursuit of obsession at all costs.Ester?s family was torn apart when a manticore killed her mother and baby brother, leaving her with nothing but her father?s painful silence and a single, overwhelming need to kill the monsters that took her family.Ester?s path leads her to the King?s Royal Mews, where the giant rocs of legend are flown to hunt manticores by their brave and dedicated ruhkers. Paired with a fledgling roc named Zahra, Ester finds purpose and acclaim by devoting herself to a calling that demands absolute sacrifice and a creature that will never return her love. The terrifying partnership between woman and roc leads Ester not only on the empire?s most dangerous manticore hunt, but on a journey of perseverance and acceptance.</p>

<p>Summary : Casi siempre comienza en los hogares. Ya se registran miles de casos en Vancouver, Hong Kong, Tel Aviv, Barcelona, Oaxaca, y se est? propagando r?pidamente a todos los rincones del mundo.Los kentukis no son mascotas, ni fantasmas, ni robots. Son ciudadanos reales, y el problema ?se dice en las noticias y se comparte en las redes? es que una persona que vive en Berl?n no deber?a poder pasearse libremente por el living de otra que vive en Sidney, ni alguien que vive en Bangkok desayunar junto a tus hijos en tu departamento de Buenos Aires. En especial cuando esas personas que dejamos entrar a casa son completamente an?nimas.Los personajes de esta novela encarnan el aspecto m?s real ?y a la vez imprevisible? de la compleja relaci?n que tenemos con la tecnolog?a, reavivando la noci?n del exhibicionismo y exponiendo al lector a los l?mites del prejuicio, el cuidado de los otros, la intimidad, el deseo y las buenas intenciones. Kentukis es una novela deslumbrante que potencia su sentido </p>

<p>Summary : Race and Racisms: A Critical Approach engages students in significant questions related to racial dynamics in the U.S. and around the world. Written in accessible, straightforward language, the book discusses and critically analyzes cutting-edge scholarship in the field. Organized into topics and concepts rather than discrete racial groups, the text addresses: * How and when the idea of race was created and developed* How structural racism has worked historically to reproduce inequality* How we have a society rampant with racial inequality, even though most people do not consider themselves to be racist* How race, class, and gender work together to create inequality and identities* How immigration policy in the United States has been racialized* How racial justice could be imagined and realized Centrally focused on racial dynamics, Race and Racisms also incorporates an intersectional perspective, discussing the intersections of racism, patriarchy, and capitalism.</p>

<p>Summary : ?Qu? pas? con B?rbara Molina? Nunca se encontr? su cuerpo ni se consiguieron pruebas para detener a ning?n culpable. Una llamada a un m?vil pone patas arriba el destino de muchas personas: el de un polic?a a punto de jubilarse, el de una madre que ha perdido la esperanza de encontrar a su hija desaparecida, el de una chica que traicion? a su mejor amiga. Palabras envenenadas es una cr?nica de un d?a trepidante, vivido a contrarreloj y protagonizado por tres personas cercanas a B?rbara Molina, desaparecida misteriosa y violentamente cuando ten?a quince a?os. Un enigma que, despu?s de cuatro a?os sin resolverse, va a verse sacudido por nuevas claves. A veces, la verdad permanece oculta en la oscuridad y s?lo se ilumina al abrir una ventana.</p>

<p>Summary : The authors of oral literature in the Pashtun language create their work at a far remove from any books. Generally deprived of the support of schools and universities, their compositions are inseparable from song. Their poetry is never declaimed; rather, their rhyme and rhythm have melodic value.These popular improvisations do not exalt mystic love. In them there is no aspiration whatsoever to an unfathomable and incommunicable heaven, nor devotion to the lord, nor praise for an absolute master, nor any Adonis. To the contrary, they are songs of the earth. They celebrate nature, mountains, rivers, dawn and night?s magnetic space. They are songs of war and honor, shame and love, beauty and death. The repression of Afghan women has caused untold suffering, particularly through moral subjugation. Infant daughters and their mothers are received with scorn and shame, and lead lives of subordination and humiliation. Their rebellion against these tribal codes comes only through suicide and </p>

<p>Summary : For the first time ever, a very special edition of the classic masterpiece, illustrated throughout in colour by the author himself and with the complete text printed in two colours. Since it was first published in 1954, The Lord of the Rings has been a book people have treasured. Steeped in unrivalled magic and otherworldliness, its sweeping fantasy and epic adventure has touched the hearts of young and old alike. Over 150 million copies of its many editions have been sold around the world, and occasional collectors? editions become prized and valuable items of publishing.This one-volume hardback edition contains the complete text, fully corrected and reset, which is printed in red and black and features, for the very first time, thirty colour illustrations, maps and sketches drawn by Tolkien himself as he composed this epic work. These include the pages from the Book of Mazarbul, marvellous facsimiles created by Tolkien to accompany the famous ?Bridge of Khazad-dum? chapter. Also </p>

<p>Summary : Questo libro ? il racconto di un cammino, quello che Gemma Capra, vedova del commissario Calabresi, ha percorso dal giorno dell&#8217;omicidio del marito, cinquant&#8217;anni fa.Una strada tortuosa che, partendo dall&#8217;umano desiderio di vendetta di una ragazza di 25 anni con due bambini piccoli e un terzo in arrivo, l&#8217;ha condotta, non senza fatica, al crescere i suoi figli lontani da ogni tentazione di rancore e rabbia e all&#8217;abbracciare, nel tempo e con sempre pi? determinazione, l&#8217;idea del perdono.Un racconto che, partendo dalla vita di una giovane coppia che viene sconvolta dalla strage di Piazza Fontana, attraversa mezzo secolo, ricucendo i momenti intimi e privati con le vicende pubbliche della societ? italiana.Un&#8217;intensa e sincera testimonianza sul senso della giustizia e della memoria. Una storia di amore e pace.</p>

<p>Summary : Laboratorio lector presenta una visi?n amplia, interdisciplinaria y divertida de la lectura. Es solo un libro, pero incluye toda clase de experimentos, como en unos aut?nticos ?juegos reunidos?: comprobar la amplitud de las fijaciones oculares, descubrir los automatismos del cerebro, tomar conciencia de las inferencias que hacemos o de la manera en que trabaja la memoria o revisar las estrategias con que exploramos un escrito para detectar su intenci?n, su estructura o su ideolog?a.Tambi?n incluye reflexiones sobre internet y la lectura digital. Ense?a a buscar informaci?n, a distinguir las webs fiables de las enga?osas, a utilizar m?s eficazmente los traductores inform?ticos o a evitar los plagios. Al mismo tiempo critica algunos lugares comunes, como el de la poes?a, que supuestamente expresa los sentimientos del autor ?pero tambi?n los de los lectores? o el de las matem?ticas, que parece que cuantifiquen la realidad de manera objetiva ?pero que tambi?n persuaden y manipulan.Si te </p>

<p>Summary : The wisdom and artistry of Latin America&#8217;s storytellers preserve one of the world&#8217;s richest folktale traditions?combining the lore of medieval Europe, the ancient Near East, and pre-Columbian America. Among the essential characters are the quiet man&#8217;s wife who knew the Devil&#8217;s secrets, the three daughters who robbed their father&#8217;s grave, and the wife in disguise who married her own husband?not to mention the Bear&#8217;s son, the tricksters Fox and Monkey, the two compadres, and the classic rogue Pedro de Urdemalas.Gathered from twenty countries, including the United States, the stories are brought together here in a core collection of one hundred tales arranged in the form of a velorio, or wake, the most frequent occasion for public storytelling. The tales are preceded by a selection of early Colonial legends foreshadowing the themes of Latino folklore and are followed by a carefully chosen group of modern Indian myths that replay the basic stories in a contrasting key.

Among the essential characters are the quiet man&amp;#8217;s wife who knew the Devil&amp;#8217;s secrets, the three daughters who robbed their father&amp;#8217;s grave, and the wife in disguise who married her own husband?not to mention the Bear&amp;#8217;s son, the tricksters Fox and Monkey, the two compadres, and the classic rogue Pedro de Urdemalas.Gathered from twenty countries, including the United States, the stories are brought together here in a core collection of one hundred tales arranged in the form of a velorio, or wake, the most frequent occasion for public storytelling. The tales are preceded by a selection of early Colonial legends foreshadowing the themes of Latino folklore and are followed by a carefully chosen group of modern Indian myths that replay the basic stories in a contrasting key.

<p>Summary : In a groundbreaking blend of science and imagination, the former president of Google China and a leading writer of speculative fiction join forces to answer an urgent question: How will artificial intelligence change our world over the next twenty years?AI will be the defining issue of the twenty-first century, but many people know little about it apart from visions of dystopian robots or flying cars. Though the term has been around for half a century, it is only now, Kai-Fu Lee argues, that AI is poised to upend our society, just as the arrival of technologies like electricity and smart phones did before it. In the past five years, AI has shown it can learn games like chess in mere hours&#8211;and beat humans every time. AI has surpassed humans in speech and object recognition, even outperforming radiologists in diagnosing lung cancer. AI is at a tipping point.

<p>Summary : Fugitive Apprehension Agent Stephanie Plum has a big problem on her hands: Seven-year-old Annie Soder and her mother, Evelyn, have disappeared.Evelyn&#8217;s estranged husband, Steven, a shady owner of a seedy bar, is not at all happy. During the divorce proceedings, he and Evelyn signed a child custody bond, and Steven is demanding the money guaranteed by the bond to find Annie. The money was secured by a mortgage on Evelyn&#8217;s grandmother&#8217;s house, and the True Blue Bonds Bail Agency wants to take possession of the house.Finding a kidnapped child is not an assignment for a bounty hunter. But Evelyn&#8217;s grandmother lives next door to Stephanie&#8217;s parents, and Stephanie&#8217;s mother and grandmother are not about to see their neighbor lose her house because of abduction.Even though Stephanie&#8217;s plate is full with miscreants who missed their court dates, including old nemesis and violent drunk Andy Bender and an elusive little old lady accused of grand theft auto, she can&#8217;t disappoint Grandma Mazur!

<p>Summary : The first comprehensive yet accessible history of the state of Israel from its inception to present day, from Daniel Gordis, &#8220;one of the most respected Israel analysts&#8221; (The Forward) living and writing in Jerusalem.Israel is a tiny state, and yet it has captured the world?s attention, aroused its imagination, and lately, been the object of its opprobrium. Why does such a small country speak to so many global concerns? More pressingly: Why does Israel make the decisions it does? And what lies in its future?We cannot answer these questions until we understand Israel?s people and the questions and conflicts, the hopes and desires, that have animated their conversations and actions. Though Israel?s history is rife with conflict, these conflicts do not fully communicate the spirit of Israel and its people: they give short shrift to the dream that gave birth to the state, and to the vision for the Jewish people that was at its core. Guiding us through the milestones of Israeli history, </p>

<p>Summary : Published over thirty years ago and now with a new introduction by the author, this classic work presents the methods and conclusions of more than 25 years of experimentation with the isolation tank meditative experience. Drawing on the personal testimony of many who tried it, including Burgess Meredith, Gregory Bateson, E.J. Gold &amp; Jerry Rubin, the evidence shows how, by eliminating the presence of shifting physical input patterns, the tank allows participants to dive deep into the subconscious &amp; focus immediately on inner perceptions. The different domains of reality &amp; how various experiences with solitude affect different people are discussed along with practical details on the standards for isolation tank use &amp; manufacture.</p>

<p>Summary : A man is in a hospital in Sussex. He was shipwrecked when the Alice Aiden, the coastal boat heading to Glasgow encountered a thick fog. This man lost his memory, he can?t say who he is but keeps talking in his sleep about a Jim Randall or Jim Riddel. The nurses advertise on the radio that a man named Jim Randall or Jim Riddel has been found; if anyone knows him, they can pick him up. Nesta Riddel hears the message and decides to go and fetch him, especially when she realizes that he relentlessly mentions the eight emeralds that she and her accomplice Jim Riddel have stolen from the rich New-Yorker Elmer van Berg. The robbery has been making the headlines for a few weeks as Elmer was shot by the thief and is in a coma. A few days after the injured man has left the hospital with Nesta, Caroline shows up there, explaining she thinks the man could be her cousin Jim Randal.Who is that man? Where are the stolen emeralds? Will Elmer van Berg wake up?</p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;Ich liebe dich, Helena. Wahrscheinlich sollte ich das nicht sagen, weil es alles nur schlimmer macht, aber ich kann nicht anders.&#8221;Helena kann es nicht fassen: In dem Moment, als ihr Gl?ck mit Jess endlich zum Greifen nah ist, wird es ihr schon wieder entrissen. Gerade haben die beiden beschlossen, sich all denen zu widersetzen, die ihre Liebe verhindern wollen, da greifen Unbekannte Jess an und verletzen ihn lebensgef?hrlich. Doch wer hat es auf ihn abgesehen? Und warum? Helena muss sich erneut auf die Suche nach Antworten begeben, die gef?hrlich eng mit dem Tod von Valerie und Adam verwoben sind.

<p>Summary : &#8220;Ich liebe dich, Helena. Wahrscheinlich sollte ich das nicht sagen, weil es alles nur schlimmer macht, aber ich kann nicht anders.&#8221;Helena kann es nicht fassen: In dem Moment, als ihr Gl?ck mit Jess endlich zum Greifen nah ist, wird es ihr schon wieder entrissen. Gerade haben die beiden beschlossen, sich all denen zu widersetzen, die ihre Liebe verhindern wollen, da greifen Unbekannte Jess an und verletzen ihn lebensgef?hrlich. Doch wer hat es auf ihn abgesehen? Und warum? Helena muss sich erneut auf die Suche nach Antworten begeben, die gef?hrlich eng mit dem Tod von Valerie und Adam verwoben sind. Und je n?her sie der Wahrheit kommt, desto mehr fragt sie sich, ob sie und Jess jemals eine gemeinsame Zukunft haben k?nnen &#8211; oder ob ihre Liebe nicht von Anfang an zum Scheitern verurteilt war &#8230;</p>

<p>Summary : Discover the ways you have been inadvertently communicating negative, positive, neutral, or mixed messages with the simple body movements you habitually make without even thinking about it. Know when someone is lying to you!Do you ever feel that someone&#8217;s gestures are telling you something different than the words they are saying? Has a cashier asked you how you are without glancing up from the items he or she is scanning? Have you ever felt that the firmness of your words is undermined by your feeble body language? Although spoken and written language may seem like our primary methods of communicating with one another, body language plays a strikingly prominent role, making up more than 90 percent of communication.Turchet makes us aware of the true importance of body language in all contexts, relationships, and encounters, and explains how body language embedded in our genetic makeup has the remarkable ability to transcend the language barriers and communicate universal meaning. </p>

<p>Summary : Nico VitaleThe girl I fell in love with was ripped from my arms, never to be heard from again.She was sold to the cruelest man on the planet, Constantine Carbone ? my family?s number one enemy.Over the years, I haven?t stopped looking for Selina.And then one fateful night, I finally find her.In a move that will undoubtedly bring war upon my family, I save Selina, killing Constantine?s son in the process.I soon come to realize that Selina is nothing like the girl I once fell in love with, but none of that matters.She?s mine.She?s always been mine.And when her past comes back to haunt her, threatening to steal her away from me again, I vow to do whatever it takes to keep her safe.This time I?m not letting her go.Author&#8217;s note: Keeping My Girl is Nico Vitale?s story, and although it is a standalone, it would be better enjoyed after reading Keeping My Bride.**Warning: Due to the sensitive subject matter contained in this book, it may cause triggers.

<p>Summary : Nico VitaleThe girl I fell in love with was ripped from my arms, never to be heard from again.She was sold to the cruelest man on the planet, Constantine Carbone ? my family?s number one enemy.Over the years, I haven?t stopped looking for Selina.And then one fateful night, I finally find her.In a move that will undoubtedly bring war upon my family, I save Selina, killing Constantine?s son in the process.I soon come to realize that Selina is nothing like the girl I once fell in love with, but none of that matters.She?s mine.She?s always been mine.And when her past comes back to haunt her, threatening to steal her away from me again, I vow to do whatever it takes to keep her safe.This time I?m not letting her go.Author&#8217;s note: Keeping My Girl is Nico Vitale?s story, and although it is a standalone, it would be better enjoyed after reading Keeping My Bride.**Warning: Due to the sensitive subject matter contained in this book, it may cause triggers.

<p>Summary : He?s not just rich?he?s filthy rich.When I started working at Salacious Players? Club, I never expected to end up on the auction block ready to grant a date to the highest bidder.This club is not really my scene. I?m not the kind of girl rich guys take home. I?m more a piano playing, van-living, free spirit kind of girl.So when Ronan Kade, the richest man at the club, puts down over a hundred grand for my time, how can I tell him no?But he?s too old. Too rich. Too cocky.And oh yeah?he once dated my mother.Except he doesn?t know that. He has no idea who I am.One date turns into a trip to Paris. And an offer to live with him in his penthouse. Then a promise to take care of me.Before I know it, I?m calling this silver fox my daddy.Ronan Kade only bid on one date, but I think he?s winning much more than that.Can we overcome the years between us to find happiness?And will he find it in him to forgive me when he learns the secret I?ve been keeping?</p>

<p>Summary : A direct and fundamentally optimistic indictment of the short-sightedness and intellectual arrogance that has characterized much of urban planning in this century, The Death and Life of Great American Cities has, since its first publication in 1961, become the standard against which all endeavors in that field are measured. In prose of outstanding immediacy, Jane Jacobs writes about what makes streets safe or unsafe; about what constitutes a neighborhood, and what function it serves within the larger organism of the city; about why some neighborhoods remain impoverished while others regenerate themselves. She writes about the salutary role of funeral parlors and tenement windows, the dangers of too much development money and too little diversity. Compassionate, bracingly indignant, and always keenly detailed, Jane Jacobs&#8217;s monumental work provides an essential framework for assessing the vitality of all cities.</p>

And she has no intention of dying &#8211; been there, done that. Not that she&#8217;ll be the easy prey the Aeons are expecting. They have no knowledge of the &#8230; thing that lives inside her.

<p>Summary : President Obama&#8217;s hope of bringing a new kind of politics to Washington has fallen on hard times, with hardening party lines reflecting ideological polarization. Utilizing the organizing theme of partisan gridlock in the seventh edition&#8217;s introductory materials and author headnotes, editor Michael Cummings reminds readers that partisanship has long been a recurring problem for Americans, dating back to the deadly conflicts among the Iroquois nations, to the debates of the constitutional convention, and to the near destruction of the young republic during the Civil War.</p>

<p>Summary : Edmund and the Childe were swapped at birth. Now Edmund lives in secret as a changeling in the World Above, with fae powers that make him different from everyone else?even his unwitting parents and older sister, Alexis. The Childe lives among the fae in the World Below, where being human makes him an oddity at the royal palace, and where his only friend is a wax golem named Whick.But when the cruel sorceress Hawthorne takes the throne, the Childe and Edmund realize that the fate of both worlds may be in their hands?even if they?re not sure which world they belong to.</p>

<p>Summary : In Arcadia, winter has no heart.I make magic dresses for a living. I?m not rich or pretty enough to wear them, but I love what I do, working out of my family?s shop on Carnaby Street in London?until the fae show up.It?s a straight-up kidnapping, and before I know it, I?m brought to this wintry place of cold hearts and beautiful nightmares, but that?s not the worst part.The worst part is, they think I?m fae, and I?m supposed to participate in some competition against a host of other women who have been training their whole lives for this. The prize? The winner is to marry the Prince.On the surface that sounds almost like a fairytale, only this competition is brutal and bloody, and the Prince is the jerk that kidnapped me. I can?t get too close to him or he?ll know I?m not fae, and then I?m dead. But I want to get close to him. His body burns with the fire of a cold star, and I?m drawn to him.I need to fight the pull and survive long enough to find a way out of here, but these winter </p>

As believers, we have Christ and never need to be afraid. Yet it&#8217;s also true that we are not immune to the effects of evil. Christ has conquered sin and death, but in his infinite wisdom&#8211;for reasons that are often difficult for us to understand&#8211;evil is still permitted to exist. Even if we&#8217;re saved and trust in Christ, we may still find areas in which we just can&#8217;t get victory. Maybe it&#8217;s a sin we&#8217;ve confessed again and again or a constant struggle with depression, anger, or lust. These long-imbedded patterns of shameful living continue to entangle us day after day, month after month, and even year after year.In &#8220;Truly Free &#8220;best-selling author Robert Morris invites us into a glorious truth&#8211;that the promise of being set free from the slavery of sin is a promise to be set free &#8220;completely.&#8221; Although evil is real and Christians can be </p>

<p>Summary : A story of love and duty set in San Francisco&#8217;s Chinatown during the Red Scare.?That book. It was about two women, and they fell in love with each other.? And then Lily asked the question that had taken root in her, that was even now unfurling its leaves and demanding to be shown the sun: ?Have you ever heard of such a thing??Seventeen-year-old Lily Hu can?t remember exactly when the question took root, but the answer was in full bloom the moment she and Kathleen Miller walked under the flashing neon sign of a lesbian bar called the Telegraph Club.America in 1954 is not a safe place for two girls to fall in love, especially not in Chinatown. Red-Scare paranoia threatens everyone, including Chinese Americans like Lily. With deportation looming over her father?despite his hard-won citizenship?Lily and Kath risk everything to let their love see the light of day.</p>

<p>Summary : A story of love and duty set in San Francisco&#8217;s Chinatown during the Red Scare.?That book. It was about two women, and they fell in love with each other.? And then Lily asked the question that had taken root in her, that was even now unfurling its leaves and demanding to be shown the sun: ?Have you ever heard of such a thing??Seventeen-year-old Lily Hu can?t remember exactly when the question took root, but the answer was in full bloom the moment she and Kathleen Miller walked under the flashing neon sign of a lesbian bar called the Telegraph Club.America in 1954 is not a safe place for two girls to fall in love, especially not in Chinatown. Red-Scare paranoia threatens everyone, including Chinese Americans like Lily. With deportation looming over her father?despite his hard-won citizenship?Lily and Kath risk everything to let their love see the light of day.</p>

<p>Summary : The inspiring true story of one man?s treacherous boyhood journey from a rural village in Ghana to the streets of Barcelona?and the path that led him home.Ousman Umar is a shaman?s son born in a small village in Ghana. Though his mother died giving birth, he spent a contented childhood working the fields, setting traps in the jungle, and living off the land. Still, as strange and wondrous flying machines crisscrossed the skies overhead, Ousman dreamed of a different life. And so, when he was only twelve years old, he left his village and began what would be a five-year journey to Europe.Every step of the way, as he traveled across the Sahara desert, through the daunting metropolises of Accra, Tripoli, Benghazi, and Casablanca, and over the Mediterranean Sea aboard a packed migrant dinghy, Ousman was handed off like merchandise by a loose network of smugglers and in the constant, foreboding company of ?sinkers?: other migrants who found themselves penniless and alone on their way </p>

<p>Summary : The Black Coast is the start of a series filled with war-dragons, armoured knights, sea-faring raiders, dangerous magic and battle scenes.When the citizens of Black Keep see ships on the horizon, terror takes them, for they know who is coming: for generations, Black Keep has been raided by the fearsome clanspeople of Iwernia. Saddling their war dragons, the Naridans rush to defend their home only to discover that the clanspeople have not come to pillage at all. Driven from their own homeland by the rise of a daemonic despot who prophesies the end of the world, they have come in search of a new home. Meanwhile the wider continent of Narida is lurching toward war. Black Keep is about to be caught in the cross-fire of the coming war for the world ? if only its new mismatched society can survive.</p>

<p>Summary : Based on the research that race, gender, consent, and body positivity should be discussed with toddlers on up, this read-aloud board book series offers adults the opportunity to begin important conversations with young children in an informed, safe, and supported way.Developed by experts in the fields of early childhood and activism against injustice, this topic-driven board book offers clear, concrete language and imagery to introduce the concept of CONSENT. This book serves to normalize and celebrate the experience of asking for and being asked for permission to do something involving one&#8217;s body. It centers on respect for bodily autonomy, and reviews the many ways that one can say or indicate &#8216;NO&#8217;.While young children are avid observers and questioners of their world, adults often shut down or postpone conversations on complicated topics because it&#8217;s hard to know where to begin. Research shows that talking about issues like race, gender, and our bodies from the age of two not only </p>

<p>Summary : Many texts on criminal investigation present the same investigative process for every type of crime. However, each crime type requires a unique approach with distinct steps. An investigation involving a death is no different. All incidents of death should be processed as a homicide until they can be proven otherwise. In order to do so correctly, all investigative procedures specifically related to death investigation should be applied. Death Investigations ? The 2nd Edition is a follow-up to the successful first edition published in 2013. This book brings to light many of the nuances that frequently confront death investigators and provides them with sound advice and guidelines of how to resolve these incidents. The authors cannot tell you how to solve a homicide, but with their combined decades of experience, can tell you how some homicides have been solved.</p>

Fearless, candid, and incredibly funny, Lauren Holmes is a newcomer who writes like a master.

In Desert Hearts, a woman takes a job selling sex toys in San Francisco rather than embark on the law career she pursued only for the sake of her father. In Pearl and the Swiss Guy Fall in Love, a woman realizes she much prefers the company of her pit bull and </p>

Fearless, candid, and incredibly funny, Lauren Holmes is a newcomer who writes like a master. She tackles eros and intimacy with a deceptively light touch, a keen awareness of how their nervous systems tangle and sometimes short-circuit, and a genius for revealing our most vulnerable, spirited selves. In Desert Hearts, a woman takes a job selling sex toys in San Francisco rather than embark on the law career she pursued only for the sake of her father.

<p>Summary : In the middle of the night, in a house on a quiet street in suburban Minneapolis, intruders silently murder Luke Ellis?s parents and load him into a black SUV. The operation takes less than two minutes. Luke will wake up at The Institute, in a room that looks just like his own, except there?s no window. And outside his door are other doors, behind which are other kids with special talents?telekinesis and telepathy?who got to this place the same way Luke did: Kalisha, Nick, George, Iris, and ten-year-old Avery Dixon. They are all in Front Half. Others, Luke learns, graduated to Back Half, ?like the roach motel,? Kalisha says. ?You check in, but you don?t check out.?In this most sinister of institutions, the director, Mrs. Sigsby, and her staff are ruthlessly dedicated to extracting from these children the force of their extranormal gifts. There are no scruples here. If you go along, you get tokens for the vending machines. If you don?t, punishment is brutal. As each new victim </p>

Los estudios realizados avalan que las sirtuinas mejoran la capacidad del organismo de quemar grasas y permiten perder peso sin p?rdida de masa muscular. La dieta Sirtfood se llev? a cabo y comprob? en uno de los m?s exclusivos clubs londinenses dedicados a la salud y el mantenimiento f?sico, y hasta hace muy poco ha sido un secreto muy bien guardado.
