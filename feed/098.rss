<p>Summary : Never tell a lie. Especially not to a cocky CEO who knows exactly how to seduce you. They always come back to bite.I should have remembered that before I spent the night with Liam Salinger.In my defense, he?s stupidly attractive and knows it. He also willingly admitted to me that he never sleeps with the same woman twice.So I shouldn?t feel too bad about lying to him the next morning. We can forget about each other and get on with our lives, right?Wrong.We?ve both been chosen as godparents to my best friend?s gorgeous newborn. Which means we?ll be spending a lot of time together, much to our mutual disgust.And yes, he looks great cradling a tiny baby against his expensively attired chest. Plus he?s funny, irreverent, and weirdly protective toward me.But I?m not going to fall for his charm. Not a second time.I just have to keep telling myself that.</p>

<p>Summary : Two Golden Age classics from Japan&#8217;s grand master of mystery. Edogawa Rampo (pseudonym of Hirai Taro, 1894-1965) is the acknowledged grand master of Japan&#8217;s golden age of crime and mystery fiction. In the early part of his career, he created the Japanese gothic mystery, developing the work of Edgar Allan Poe and related nineteenth century writers in a distinctly Japanese form. This part of his career coincided with a great flowering in Japanese literature and culture, a relatively free and uninhibited popular press being a defining feature of the times. In this context, Rampo&#8217;s dark vision and extravagant grotesquery found an avid readership, and had a profound influence on other writers. The Black Lizard, a master criminal as deadly as she is beautiful, wagers all in an epic battle with a master detective. A mystery writer vows to protect the woman he secretly loves from the Beast in the Shadows, but disaster strikes when he turns detective himself.</p>

<p>Summary : Un piccolo raffinato college nel Vermont. Cinque ragazzi ricchi e viziati e il loro eccentrico e affascinante professore di greco antico, che insegna al di fuori delle regole accademiche imposte dall?universit? e solamente a una cerchia ristretta di studenti. Un??lite di giovani che vivono di eccessi e illusioni, lontani dalla realt? che li circonda e immersi nella celebrazione di un passato mitico e idealizzato, tra studi classici e riti dionisiaci, alcol, droghe e sottili giochi erotici. Fino a che, in una notte maledetta, esplode la violenza. E il loro mondo inizia a crollare inesorabilmente, pezzo dopo pezzo.Una storia folgorante di amicizia e complicit?, amore e ossessione, colpa e follia, un romanzo di formazione che ? stato uno dei pi? grandi casi editoriali degli anni Novanta.</p>

Cinque ragazzi ricchi e viziati e il loro eccentrico e affascinante professore di greco antico, che insegna al di fuori delle regole accademiche imposte dall?universit? e solamente a una cerchia ristretta di studenti. Un??lite di giovani che vivono di eccessi e illusioni, lontani dalla realt? che li circonda e immersi nella celebrazione di un passato mitico e idealizzato, tra studi classici e riti dionisiaci, alcol, droghe e sottili giochi erotici. Fino a che, in una notte maledetta, esplode la violenza. E il loro mondo inizia a crollare inesorabilmente, pezzo dopo pezzo.Una storia folgorante di amicizia e complicit?, amore e ossessione, colpa e follia, un romanzo di formazione che ? stato uno dei pi? grandi casi editoriali degli anni Novanta.

In Mitch Albom?s profound new novel of hope and faith, a group of shipwrecked passengers pull a strange man from the sea. He claims to be ?the Lord.? And he says he can only save them if they all believe in him. Adrift in a raft after a deadly ship explosion, nine people struggle for survival at sea. Three days pass. Short on water, food and hope, they spot a man floating in the waves. They pull him in.?Thank the Lord we found you,? a passenger says.?I am the Lord,? the man whispers.So begins Mitch Albom?s most beguiling and inspiring novel yet.Albom has written of heaven in the celebrated number one bestsellers, The Five People You Meet in Heaven, and The First Phone Call from Heaven. Now, for the first time in his fiction, he ponders what we would do if, after crying out for divine help, God actually appeared before us? What might the Lord look, sound and act like?In, The Stranger in the Lifeboat, Albom keeps </p>

<p>Summary : One year as Mrs. James Roth will keep her family safe from his wrath. All she has to do is play the loving wife in public? He failed to negotiate how she should behave in private.This is a business arrangement, nothing more. Once her time is up, she?ll walk away and it won?t be like the last time when he broke her into little pieces. It doesn?t matter that their chemistry still burns white-hot or that sometimes, she catches a glimpse of the man she once knew. That man is gone. In his place is a ruthless stranger with an appetite for revenge, a dark past, and bitter secrets he?ll do anything to keep buried.</p>

If you follow these few simple steps and the rest of the essential tips in How to Make Friends with a Ghost, you&#8217;ll see how a ghost friend will lovingly grow up and grow old with you. A whimsical story about ghost care, Rebecca Green&#8217;s debut picture book is a perfect combination of offbeat humor, quirky and sweet illustrations, and the timeless theme of friendship.</p>

<p>Summary : At midnight, one of them is dead.By morning, all of them are suspects. <br />
  It&#8217;s a party to end all parties, but not everyone is here to celebrate. <br />
 On New Year?s Eve, Rhys Lloyd has a house full of guests. His vacation homes on Mirror Lake are a success, and he?s generously invited the village to drink champagne with their wealthy new neighbors. <br />
  But by midnight, Rhys will be floating dead in the freezing waters of the lake. <br />
On New Year?s Day, Ffion Morgan has a village full of suspects. The tiny community is her home, so the suspects are her neighbors, friends and family?and Ffion has her own secrets to protect.With a lie uncovered at every turn, soon the question isn?t who wanted Rhys dead?but who finally killed him. <br />
  In a village with this many secrets, murder is just the beginning.</p>

But by midnight, Rhys will be floating dead in the freezing waters of the lake. On New Year?s Day, Ffion Morgan has a village full of suspects. The tiny community is her home, so the suspects are her neighbors, friends and family?and Ffion has her own secrets to protect.With a lie uncovered at every turn, soon the question isn?t who wanted Rhys dead?but who finally killed him. In a village with this many secrets, murder is just the beginning.

<p>Summary : In the future, humankind has tried to develop artificial intelligence, succeeding only once, and then disastrously. Little remains of the first experiment, except for a transmission from the remote site, garbled but for the words &#8216;rogue consciousness!&#8217;. The site is now an empty hole.The project has been moved to the moon, where the scientists have cloned themselves. These clones, identified by the middle name &#8216;Lon&#8217;, are kept isolated and raised to believe that they are the crew of a spaceship that will colonize another planet. The spaceship will be multi-generational, needing only a crew of six, and carrying thousands of other clones in hibernation. As the original crew dies off, other clones will be awoken. The clone crew is really just a caretaker: the ship is controlled by a disembodied human brain (known by the euphemism &#8216;Organic Mental Core&#8217;, further euphemised as &#8220;OMC&#8221;) that runs the complex operations of the vessel and keeps it moving in space.

<p>Summary : In this addition to the award-winning BECNT series, a respected New Testament scholar offers a substantive evangelical commentary on 2 Corinthians. George Guthrie leads readers through the intricacies of literary structure, word meanings, cultural backdrop, and theological proclamation, offering insights applicable to modern ministry contexts. As with all BECNT volumes, this commentary features the author&#8217;s detailed interaction with the Greek text, extensive research, thoughtful chapter-by-chapter exegesis, and an acclaimed, user-friendly design. It admirably achieves the dual aims of the series&#8211;academic sophistication with pastoral sensitivity and accessibility&#8211;making it a useful tool for pastors, church leaders, students, and teachers.</p>

<p>Summary : Philosophy for Life looks at how people use ancient philosophy today, to cope with adversity and build flourishing lives. It explores the direct influence of ancient philosophy on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy and Positive Psychology. It was described as &#8216;something of a revelation&#8217; by the Observer, and as &#8216;a wonderful book, beautifully written&#8217; by Lord Richard Layard of the LSE.</p>

<p>Summary : What is gender dysphoria? How does it affect people? What do terms like intersex, cisgender and transsexualism mean? This book, the first of its kind, presents an easy-to-read, jargon-free guide to help anyone understand the terminology, the concept and the day-to-day reality of gender dysphoria and related concepts. TRANS is a book for everyone &#8211; insightful enough for professionals, but accessible enough for all. Put simply, TRANS explains what gender dysphoria is, how it affects people, and what is available, medically and psychotherapeutically to support people with gender dysphoria. The editor, Dr Az Hakeem, has assembled a group of contributors to give readers a truly accessible guide to the psychology and the everyday reality of gender dysphoria, transvestism, gender reassignment and being trans. The book even addresses &#8216;the difficult questions&#8217; like &#8216;What do we tell the children?&#8217; and &#8216;What happens when you change your sex, then change your mind?&#8217;</p>

<p>Summary : A mother and daughter travel from abroad to meet in Tokyo: they walk along the canals through the autumn evenings, escape the typhoon rains, share meals in small cafes and restaurants, and visit galleries to see some of the city&#8217;s most radical modern art. All the while, they talk: about the weather, horoscopes, clothes, and objects, about family, distance, and memory. But uncertainties abound. Who is really speaking here &#8211; is it only the daughter? And what is the real reason behind this elliptical, perhaps even spectral journey? At once a careful reckoning and an elegy, Cold Enough for Snow questions whether any of us speak a common language, which dimensions can contain love, and what claim we have to truly know another&#8217;s inner world.Selected from more than 1,500 entries, Cold Enough for Snow won the Novel Prize, a new, biennial award offered by Fitzcarraldo Editions, New Directions (US) and Giramondo (Australia), for any novel written in English that explores and expands the </p>

<p>Summary : Part history, part fiction, part memoir, Levels of Life is a powerfully personal and unforgettable book, and an immediate classic on the subject of grief.?Levels of Life opens in the nineteenth century with balloonists, photographers, and Sarah Bernhardt, whose adventures lead seamlessly into an entirely personal account of the author&#8217;s own great loss.??&#8221;You put together two things that have not been put together before. And the world is changed&#8230;&#8221; Julian Barnes&#8217;s new book is about ballooning, photography, love and grief; about putting two things, and two people, together, and about tearing them apart. One of the judges who awarded him the 2011 Man Booker Prize described Barnes as &#8220;an unparalleled magus of the heart.&#8221; This book confirms that opinion.</p>

But life comes with expectations, there are choices to be made, boxes to tick and ? sometimes ? stereotypes to fulfil. And when her best friends? lives start to branch away towards marriage and motherhood, leaving the path they?ve always followed together, Olive starts to question her choices ? because life according to Olive looks a little bit different.Moving, memorable and a mirror for every woman at a crossroads, OLIVE has a little bit of all of us. Told with great warmth and nostalgia, this is a modern tale about the obstacle course of adulthood, milestone decisions and the ?taboo? about choosing not to have children.</p>

<p>Summary : Author Robert M. Hazen writes of how the co-evolution of the geosphere and biosphere?of rocks and living matter?has shaped our planet into the only one of its kind in the Solar System, if not the entire cosmos.With an astrobiologist?s imagination, a historian?s perspective, and a naturalist?s passion for the ground beneath our feet, Hazen explains how changes on an atomic level translate into dramatic shifts in Earth?s makeup over its 4.567 billion year existence. He calls upon a flurry of recent discoveries to portray our planet?s many iterations in vivid detail. Through his theory of ?co-evolution,? we learn how reactions between organic molecules and rock crystals may have generated Earth?s first organisms, which in turn are responsible for more than two-thirds of the mineral varieties on the planet.The Story of Earth is also the story of the pioneering men and women behind the sciences. Readers will meet black-market meteorite hawkers of the Sahara Desert, the gun-toting Feds who </p>

<p>Summary : From highly acclaimed, bestselling author Ava Reid comes a gothic horror retelling of The Juniper Tree, set in another time and place within the world of The Wolf and the Woodsman, where a young witch seeks to discover her identity and escape the domination of her abusive wizard father, perfect for fans of Shirley Jackson and Catherynne M. Valente.A gruesome curse. A city in upheaval. A monster with unquenchable appetites. Marlinchen and her two sisters live with their wizard father in a city shifting from magic to industry. As Oblya?s last true witches, she and her sisters are little more than a tourist trap as they treat their clients with archaic remedies and beguile them with nostalgic charm. Marlinchen spends her days divining secrets in exchange for rubles and trying to placate her tyrannical, xenophobic father, who keeps his daughters sequestered from the outside world. But at night, Marlinchen and her sisters sneak out to enjoy the city?s amenities and revel in its thrills, </p>

<p>Summary : Naomi Novik ended her acclaimed, beloved nine-volume Temeraire series last year with a stunning finale, League of Dragons. Fans missing their favorite series can now rejoice: Novik returns with Golden Age and Other Stories, an original Temeraire collection as unique as the world she has created, with each tale inspired by an accompanying piece of fan art. In addition to the wonderful stories, the book contains over thirty brand-new illustrations.The Temeraire novels provide a window into an alternate nineteenth century populated with Novik?s own richly human and unforgettably draconic characters as they adventure alongside well-known historical figures. That tradition continues here. Readers will delight at appearances by fan-favorite characters from the series and historical figures like the famed explorer Matteo Ricci. In ?Planting Season,? Novik shows us an early glimpse of American dragon John Wampanoag at Boston harbor. ?Golden Age? finds a dragon who believes he remembers being </p>

<p>Summary : Eighteen-year-olds Ruben Montez and Zach Knight are two members of the boy-band Saturday, one of the biggest acts in America. Along with their bandmates, Angel Phan and Jon Braxton, the four are teen heartbreakers in front of the cameras and best friends backstage. But privately, cracks are starting to form: their once-easy rapport is straining under the pressures of fame, and Ruben confides in Zach that he?s feeling smothered by management?s pressure to stay in the closet.On a whirlwind tour through Europe, with both an unrelenting schedule and minimal supervision, Ruben and Zach come to rely on each other more and more, and their already close friendship evolves into a romance. But when they decide they?re ready to tell their fans and live freely, Zach and Ruben start to truly realize that they will never have the support of their management. How can they hold tight to each other when the whole world seems to want to come between them?</p>

<p>Summary : Throughout history, some books have changed the world. They have transformed the way we see ourselves?and each other. They have inspired debate, dissent, war and revolution. They have enlightened, outraged, provoked and comforted. They have enriched lives?and destroyed them. Now Penguin brings you the works of the great thinkers, pioneers, radicals and visionaries whose ideas shook civilization and helped make us who we are. Inspired by the myth of a man condemned to ceaselessly push a rock up a mountain and watch it roll back to the valley below, The Myth of Sisyphus transformed twentieth-century philosophy with its impassioned argument for the value of life in a world without religious meaning.</p>

<p>Summary : Where is paradise? It always seems to be elsewhere, inaccessible, outside of time. Either it existed yesterday or it will return tomorrow; it may be just around the corner, on a remote island, beyond the sea. Across a wide range of cultures, paradise is located in the distant past, in a longed-for future, in remote places or within each of us. In particular, people everywhere in the world share some kind of nostalgia for an innocence experienced at the beginning of history. For two millennia, learned Christians have wondered where on earth the primal paradise could have been located. Where was the idyllic Garden of Eden that is described in the Bible? In the Far East? In equatorial Africa? In Mesopotamia? Under the sea? Where were Adam and Eve created in their unspoiled perfection? ???????????Maps of Paradise charts the diverse ways in which scholars and mapmakers from the eighth to the twenty-first century rose to the challenge of identifying the location of paradise on a map, </p>

Los del primer tipo drenan la inteligencia, la energ?a y las capacidades de quienes los rodean, y necesitan ser siempre los m?s inteligentes: se trata de l?deres reductores. Masacran las ideas, taladran la energ?a y disminuyen el talento y el compromiso de los dem?s. Del otro lado del espectro est?n los l?deres que usan su inteligencia para ampliar el intelecto y las capacidades de la gente a su alrededor. Cuando entran a una habitaci?n se encienden focos sobre las cabezas de los presentes, las ideas fluyen y se resuelven los problemas.

This isn&#8217;t that story.I may be a prince but I sure as hell didn&#8217;t need no princess. My brother fell down that hole, and look at him now. Tied down with a ball and chain. No thanks. I prefered to fly solo. There was no one but me and the blood and screams of my victims. I was a free agent.I was also bored as fuck.At least until I saw her. The beautiful blue and green eyed angel whose music sang to my soul. What I didn&#8217;t expect was to be the hero in her story.Well shit&#8230; maybe I did need a princess after all?My mother used to tell me to close my eyes and the monster in my closet would disappear. Well I&#8217;ve had my eyes closed for awhile and the monster was still here. But the longer I sat in my cage watching Abel laugh at others pain and misery, the more I wondered if Hercules really was the hero?What about the hydra? Did anyone think of his friends and family?

I suoi argini sono scanditi da eucalypti immensi che assorbono l&#8217;acqua e prosciugano i campi, alle sue cascatelle i ragazzini fanno il bagno e aironi bianchissimi trovano rifugio. Su questa terra nuova di zecca, bonificata dai progetti ambiziosi del Duce e punteggiata di citt? appena fondate, vengono fatte insediare migliaia di persone arrivate dal Nord. Tra queste migliaia di coloni ci sono i Peruzzi. A farli scendere dalle pianure padane sono il carisma e il coraggio di zio Pericle. Con lui scendono i vecchi genitori, tutti i fratelli, le nuore.

I suoi argini sono scanditi da eucalypti immensi che assorbono l&#8217;acqua e prosciugano i campi, alle sue cascatelle i ragazzini fanno il bagno e aironi bianchissimi trovano rifugio. Su questa terra nuova di zecca, bonificata dai progetti ambiziosi del Duce e punteggiata di citt? appena fondate, vengono fatte insediare migliaia di persone arrivate dal Nord. Tra queste migliaia di coloni ci sono i Peruzzi. A farli scendere dalle pianure padane sono il carisma e il coraggio di zio Pericle. Con lui scendono i vecchi genitori, tutti i fratelli, le nuore.

His goal is to share a variety of practical survival skills, principles, and ideas in an easy-to read format that will aid the reader in becoming stronger, safer, and more self-reliant.

Although the data and concepts in Total Survival are derived from accounts of acute disasters?such as tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, and epidemics?they apply equally well to chronic disasters, such as economic decline, shortages, </p>

<p>Summary : You have good reason to be afraid. . . . It was a case that haunts Bobby Dodge to this day?the case that nearly killed him and changed his life forever. Now, in an underground chamber on the grounds of an abandoned Massachusetts mental hospital, the gruesome discovery of six mummified corpses resurrects his worst nightmare: the return of a killer he thought dead and buried. There?s no place to run. . . . Bobby?s only lead is wrapped around a dead woman?s neck. Annabelle Granger has been in hiding for as long as she can remember. Her childhood was a blur of new cities and assumed identities. But what?or who?her family was running from, she never knew. Now a body is unearthed from a grave, wearing a necklace bearing Annabelle?s name, and the danger is too close to escape. This time, she?s not going to run. You know he will find you. . . . The new threat could be the dead psychopath?s copycat, his prot?g?or something far more terrifying. Dodge knows the only way to find him is to solve </p>

<p>Summary : Australian deserts remain dotted with the ruins of old mosques. Beginning with a Bengali poetry collection discovered in a nineteenth-century mosque in the town of Broken Hill, Samia Khatun weaves together the stories of various peoples colonized by the British Empire to chart a history of South Asian diaspora. Australia has long been an outpost of Anglo empires in the Indian Ocean world, today the site of military infrastructure central to the surveillance of &#8216;Muslim-majority&#8217; countries across the region. Imperial knowledges from Australian territories contribute significantly to the Islamic-Western binary of the post- Cold War era. In narrating a history of Indian Ocean connections from the perspectives of those colonized by the British, Khatun highlights alternative contexts against which to consider accounts of non-white people. Australianama challenges a central idea that powerfully shapes history books across the Anglophone world: the colonial myth that European knowledge </p>

<p>Summary : She lay beside him, staring blankly at the ceiling. The deed was done. They were mated. It didn&#8217;t matter that she had no love for him nor he for her. Political alliances were more important than feelings, or so she had been told. That fact was cold comfort right now as her heart broke within her.Elise had no idea when she came home that day that she&#8217;d end up mated to a complete stranger. A new Alpha and the need for an alliance between packs have made her a pawn.</p>

<p>Summary : This is a rare book on a rare topic: it is about &#8216;action&#8217; and the Principle of Least Action. A surprisingly well-kept secret, these ideas are at the heart of physical science and engineering. Physics is well known as being concerned with grand conservatory principles (e.g. the conservation of energy) but equally important is the optimization principle (such as getting somewhere in the shortest time or with the least resistance). The book explains: why an optimization principle underlies physics, what action is, what `the Hamiltonian&#8217; is, and how new insights into energy, space, and time arise. It assumes some background in the physical sciences, at the level of undergraduate science, but it is not a textbook. The requisite derivations and worked examples are given but may be skim-read if desired. The author draws from Cornelius Lanczos&#8217;s book &#8220;The Variational Principles of Mechanics&#8221; (1949 and 1970). Lanczos was a brilliant mathematician and educator, but his book was for a </p>

<p>Summary : During his three terms as mayor of Curitiba, Brazil in the 1970s and ?80s, architect and urbanist Jaime Lerner transformed his city into a global model of the sustainable and livable community. From the pioneering Bus Rapid Transit system to parks designed to catch runoff and reduce flooding and the creation of pedestrian-only zones, Lerner has been the driving force behind a host of innovative urban projects. In more than forty years of work in cities around the globe, Lerner has found that changes to a community don?t need to be large-scale and expensive to have a transformative impact?in fact, one block, park, or a single person can have an outsized effect on life in the surrounding city. In Urban Acupuncture, Lerner celebrates these ?pinpricks? of urbanism?projects, people, and initiatives from around the world that ripple through their communities to uplift city life. With meditative and descriptive prose, Lerner brings readers around the world to streets and neighborhoods where </p>

<p>Summary : New York: Late 1958 Walter Withers had given the best years of his life to the CIA, setting honeytraps and reeling in the victims of his plots. But Withers has returned to his hometown for an easier, safer life as a Private Investigator. Manhattan in the late Fifties is alive with new possibilities, new sounds and new faces, including young presidential hopeful Senator Joe Keneally. Withers is assigned to bodyguard Keneally&#8217;s girlfriend at a society gathering: a simple enough job. But next morning, she&#8217;s dead &#8211; and Withers is the prime suspect. To clear his name, Withers must take on his old masters from the CIA, as well as J. Edgar Hoover&#8217;s FBI, all of them determined to set Keneally up. And Withers, expert hunter, becomes another disposable victim of the trap closing in on the Senator.</p>

By 5,000 BC a radically different human world had appeared. In place of hunters and gatherers there were farmers; in place of transient campsites there were towns.

<p>Summary : Ignite the Fire: Incendiary struck a match; Ignite the Fire: Inferno brings a firestorm!Cassie Palmer, once a down on her luck clairvoyant and now the chief seer of the supernatural world, is in the fight of her life. While on a rescue mission in Faerie, she is kidnapped by a king of the fey named Aeslinn. He is her sworn enemy and has every reason to want to kill her, yet instead he offers a trade: her life for that of her lover, John Pritkin. Cassie doesn?t know what the king?s game is, only that it involves his alliance with Zeus, the head of the ancient pantheon who used to rule all of Earth and who is determined to do so again. In order to save her lover, and the world, she has to figure out what Zeus and his royal puppet are up to. She also has to stop them, even if it means taking on the king of the gods himself.</p>

Cassie doesn?t know what the king?s game is, only that it involves his alliance with Zeus, the head of the ancient pantheon who used to rule all of Earth and who is determined to do so again. In order to save her lover, and the world, she has to figure out what Zeus and his royal puppet are up to. She also has to stop them, even if it means taking on the king of the gods himself.

<p>Summary : <br />
  Journalist Leander Kahney reveals how CEO Tim Cook has led Apple to astronomical success after the death of Steve Jobs in 2011. <br />
The death of Steve Jobs left a gaping void at one of the most innovative companies of all time. Jobs wasn&#8217;t merely Apple&#8217;s iconic founder and CEO; he was the living embodiment of a global megabrand. It was hard to imagine that anyone could fill his shoes&#8211;especially not Tim Cook, the intensely private executive who many thought of as Apple&#8217;s operations drone.But seven years later, as journalist Leander Kahney reveals in this definitive book, things at Apple couldn&#8217;t be better. Its stock has nearly tripled, making it the world&#8217;s first trillion dollar company. Under Cook&#8217;s principled leadership, Apple is pushing hard into renewable energy, labor and environmentally-friendly supply chains, user privacy, and highly-recyclable products. From the massive growth of the iPhone to lesser-known victories like the Apple Watch, Cook is leading Apple to a new era of </p>

<p>Summary : This is the first book to focus on the Fendi Baguette. Launched in 1997, the so-called Fendi Baguette instantly became one of the most popular and most important accessories of the decade, earning Fendi the Fashion Group International award for accessories in 2000 and creating an enduring style icon that women the world over coveted and collected with passion. This gorgeously illustrated book celebrates the Baguette?a story of craftsmanship, artisanship, connoisseurship, and design.A deceptively small, simple handbag to be carried under the arm like the French loaf from which it takes its name, the Fendi Baguette has been produced in more than 700 models. Some are simple and understated, while others feature unique or deluxe materials, such as embroidery, sequins, beading, leather, fur, or crocodile skin. Some are embellished with precious stones, while others are wild, limited-edition works of art designed by artists such as Damien Hirst, Richard Prince, and Jeff Koons, making the </p>

<p>Summary : Financial risk is a frequently observed and reported structural issue in leveraged buyouts. Other risks are equally prevalent but behavioural or institutional by nature. Factors like irrational decision-making, market manipulation and the lack of proper regulatory oversight are prominent indicators behind private equity?s most troubling side effects. Drawing on a wide range of case histories and references like the buyouts of Bhs, Hilton, TIM Hellas, Toys ?R? Us and Univision, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly of Private Equity investigates the industry?s drivers of success and failure. The book aims to emphasize what differentiates good transactions and fund managers from the bad and truly ugly ones. Sebastien Canderle delivers a well-researched, engaging and illuminating account of the notoriously secretive money machine of private equity and volunteers pertinent prescriptions for change.</p>

Other risks are equally prevalent but behavioural or institutional by nature. Factors like irrational decision-making, market manipulation and the lack of proper regulatory oversight are prominent indicators behind private equity?s most troubling side effects. Drawing on a wide range of case histories and references like the buyouts of Bhs, Hilton, TIM Hellas, Toys ?R? Us and Univision, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly of Private Equity investigates the industry?s drivers of success and failure. The book aims to emphasize what differentiates good transactions and fund managers from the bad and truly ugly ones. Sebastien Canderle delivers a well-researched, engaging and illuminating account of the notoriously secretive money machine of private equity and volunteers pertinent prescriptions for change.

<p>Summary : Una storia del museo rigorosa, vivace e ricca di illustrazioni, che a partire dalle collezioni rinascimentali e dal loro &#8220;allestimento&#8221; giunge a indagare le tendenze pi? recenti, segnate dall&#8217;entrata in campo dei grandi architetti e dalle esigenze di un pubblico informato e non indifferente alle lusinghe del marketing. Con uno sguardo che privilegia la situazione italiana ma si apre ampiamente al contesto europeo e internazionale, il libro rende conto delle diverse concezioni e tipologie di museo, esplorando realt? nuove e antiche, non esclusivamente artistiche. L&#8217;autrice integra il percorso storico con un approfondimento sulle vicende della tutela in Italia e sulle principali tappe legislative, e con una riflessione sulle funzioni del museo, oggi sempre pi? dibattute, anche in relazione alla forte competizione con le mostre.</p>

<p>Summary : Kristin Neff PhD, is a professor in educational psychology, and the world&#8217;s expert on self-compassion. A pioneer who established self-compassion as a field of study, Kristin offers a powerful solution for combating negativity and insecurity &#8211; the symptoms of living in a high-pressure world.Through tried and tested exercises and audio downloads, readers learn the 3 core components that will help to heal destructive emotional patterns so that you can become healthier, happier, and replace negative and destructive measures of self-worth and success with a kinder and non-judgemental approach.Self-Compassion recognises that we all have weaknesses and limitations, but in accepting this we can discover new ways to achieve improved self-confidence, contentment and reach our highest potential. Simply, easily and compassionately. Kristin Neff&#8217;s expert and practical advice offers a completely new set of personal development tools that will benefit everyone.</p>

<p>Summary : ?I could just kill you right now!? It?s something we?ve all thought at one time or another. But Ruby has actually acted on it. Three times, to be exact. Though she may be a murderer, Ruby is not a sociopath. She is an animal-loving therapist with a thriving practice. She?s felt empathy and sympathy. She?s had long-lasting friendships and relationships, and has a husband, Jason, whom she adores. But the homicide detectives at Miami Beach PD are not convinced of her happy marriage. When we meet Ruby, she is in a police interrogation room, being accused of Jason?s murder. Which, ironically, is one murder that she did not commit, though her vicious mother-in-law and a scandal-obsessed public believe differently. As she undergoes questioning, Ruby?s mind races back to all the details of her life that led her to this exact moment, and to the three dead bodies in her wake. Because though she may not have killed her husband, Ruby certainly isn?t innocent. Alternating between Ruby?s memories </p>

<p>Summary : Revealing that a beautiful and cultured European city has a dark and dangerous underbelly, this novel chronicles the violent lives of Rome&#8217;s slum inhabitants. Born in a shantytown, Tommaso Puzzilli was once young and hopeful, but he soon succumbs to life on the streets, where he must resort to crime and prostitution simply to stay alive. Written by an author who ultimately suffered the same chilling fate as one of his characters, this fictional account offers a startling portrait of the very real tragedies of urban poverty.</p>

<p>Summary : Kade:I did CPR on my mom three times before I was nine years old.The last time, I failed.So maybe I have a bit of a hero complex. And more money than god. Those two things combined make me irresistible to every messed up woman in the city. Been there, done that, failed to put humpty back together again.I?m done. No more broken, needy women for me.Except God must have a sense of humor, because I find a woman sleeping in a broken down car in front of my garage in the middle of the night.I should send her on her way. Except she?s a little unhinged. And sassy. And has thick, biteable thighs.So of course, I give her a job, and a place to stay. I?ve got a problem, alright. I already told you that.But no way is her sunshine going to draw me in. I?m done with women.Yeah, I don?t believe it either.Becca:So I got scammed, and ended up sleeping in my broken down car.It?s par for the course since my dad died. Maybe I haven&#8217;t been making the smartest choices, you know, like selling everything I </p>

<p>Summary : In Unconscious Bias in Schools, two seasoned educators describe the phenomenon of unconscious racial bias and how it negatively affects the work of educators and students in schools. ?Regardless of the amount of effort, time, and resources education leaders put into improving the academic achievement of students of color,? the authors write, ?if unconscious racial bias is overlooked, improvement efforts may never achieve their highest potential.? In order to address this bias, the authors argue, educators must first be aware of the racialized context in which we live. Through personal anecdotes and real-life scenarios, Unconscious Bias in Schools provides education leaders with an essential roadmap for addressing these issues directly. The authors draw on the literature on change management, leadership, critical race theory, and racial identity development, as well as the growing research on unconscious bias in a variety of fields, to provide guidance for creating the conditions </p>

<p>Summary : A reference tool for plotting Forced Proximity romance stories.What is the appeal to romance readers of the forced proximity trope?And how do we create unique stories that feature a situation of forced proximity?The anxiety faced by characters who are forced into being around someone they find attractive but who?s off limits is the essence of this trope. Perhaps the other person really gets on your character?s nerves big time or maybe there?s a bit of suppressed lust lurking that?s getting under their skin. This increases the tension and conflict between these two people while they deal with each other.Stories with high conflict are in demand, and therefore romance writers must equip themselves with the knowledge and resources required to ensure they?re able to come up with fresh and interesting scenarios for their characters that will satisfy the appetite of modern-day readers. <br />

Voluntarily offering it up on a silver platter at an exclusive sex club&#8230; that&#8217;s just messed up.It was dark, and in my defense, he was tall, muscled, and smelled like the most tempting sin.I couldn&#8217;t resist, and the second he touched me, I knew I was never going to be the same. It was a night filled with the kind of intensity a woman could only ever dream of. Nothing could have tainted such perfectness. At least, that&#8217;s what I thought.Because the delicious man I let rail me into oblivion isn&#8217;t the perfect stranger I thought he was. No, he&#8217;s anything but. The man who growled desperate filthy words in my ear and made my skin shiver with desire is a man I&#8217;ve known and craved all my life.My brother&#8217;s best friend.Izaac Banks has been off-limits since the beginning of time, going out of his way to make sure I know he&#8217;s unattainable. Despite my brother&#8217;s objections, I love him. I always have, and now that I&#8217;ve had a taste of the sweetest forbidden </p>

<p>Summary : Mental health expert and trauma therapist Dr. Anita Phillips reveals how boldly embracing your emotions is the key to living your most powerful life.We know our emotions are powerful. Yet all too often we&#8217;ve been taught to view our emotions with suspicion, seeing them as something to be suppressed, managed, or mastered. But what if we stopped fighting our emotions?

Just as gardens flourish in good ground, the abundant life you&#8217;ve been seeking is rooted in the soil of your heart.Unearthing links between cutting-edge scientific inquiry and Scripture&#8217;s ancient use of gardens to reveal what it means to truly flourish, Dr. Anita seamlessly </p>

<p>Summary : Understanding Development offers a comprehensive introduction to the multidimensional and evolving nature of international development in the contemporary world. This new edition has been fully revised and expanded to incorporate the key events, trends and debates that are shaping development today, such as humanitarianism and the global refugee crisis, the growing number of fragile states, and the contested nature of trade and trade deals. Building on the book&#8217;s original framework, the second edition also includes three new chapters which explore development in relation to global policy formation, focusing on the end of the UN Millennium Development Goals in 2015 and the start of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, which will run until 2030.Designed to offer something different to the standard introductions to the topic, this issues-driven text examines the debates that have generated the most interest and passion among practitioners and non-practitioners alike.

<p>Summary : <br />
  A comprehensive, sweeping history of America&#8217;s rise to global superpower&#8211;a follow up to the author&#8217;s acclaimed first volume, from our nation&#8217;s earliest days to the dawn of the twentieth century. <br />
At the turn of the twentieth century, America was at a tipping point: its population and wealth were growing rapidly, and the country had entered the world stage as a commanding political, economic, and military force. Would America retreat within their own relatively secure and geographically separate borders, or would it continue to expand its influence on an international scale?Beginning with the &#8220;honorable&#8221; Spanish American War and ending with the wreckage of World War II, Robert Kagan tracks how America&#8217;s desire to be an arbiter of peace as a young democracy has conflicted with its desire to stay neutral. Kagan shows how this moral high ground has led to mistakes and acts of ruthless ambition, but he also argues that America&#8217;s hesitation to intervene in foreign affairs has allowed </p>

<p>Summary : What a stupid expression that is in the first place: To fall in love.Like you fall into a ditch or something.Maybe people need to look where they?re going.As far as Phoebe Davies is concerned, love is to be avoided at all costs. Why would you spend your life worrying about something that turns you into a complete moron? If her best friend Polly is anything to go by, the first sniff of a relationship makes you forget about your friends (like, hello?), get completely obsessed with sex (yawn) and bang on constantly about a person who definitely isn&#8217;t as great as you think they are.So Phoebe isn&#8217;t going to fall in love, ever.But then she meets Emma . . .</p>

<p>Summary : Dos grandes referentes de la literatura de autoayuda, el Dr. Wayne W. Dyer y Esther Hicks, ponen de relieve los fundamentos de la Ley de la Atracci?n, en este libro revelador, estimulante y lleno de magia. Este libro nace del encuentro entre dos de los m?s inspiradores maestros espirituales de nuestro tiempo: el doctor Wayne W. Dyer y Esther Hicks, portavoz de Abraham, conciencia espiritual superior de la cual emana la Ley de la Atracci?n. Hicks defiende que las actitudes positivas o negativas influyen directamente sobre nuestras vidas. Por su parte, el doctor Dyer, que ha estudiado las ense?anzas de Abraham durante d?cadas, halla en este encuentro la oportunidad de discutir cuestiones fundamentales como la paternidad, la vida, el amor o el destino bajo el prisma de la Ley de la Atracci?n. As?, para Dyer es necesario acercarse a este libro con una mente abierta y positiva, pues, como ?l mismo advierte, ?la Ley de la Atracci?n est? funcionando ahora mismo, incluso mientras lees estas </p>

<p>Summary : The book will help you to stand your ground and go on with language learning, be it English or any other one you are learning. You learn how to understand a text globally without using a dictionary and why this is more effective in terms of memorising the new words and phrases than merely looking at them and mugging them up. Even the use of e-book Readers (such as Kindle) or audio books with the exercises is described in the book.The revolutionary view of starting from what you know, then using your inner created pictures, followed by exercises based on the rhythm and melody of a language will create a firm foundation for your language learning practice. You will become an autonomous language learner and improve your knowledge of foreign languages &#8211; or even decide to learn new ones as well!Based on the techniques of famous and classical polyglots like Kat? Lomb, Heinrich Schliemann and Giuseppe Mezzofanti, the author develops a widely practicable technique for those who like reading </p>

Even the use of e-book Readers (such as Kindle) or audio books with the exercises is described in the book.The revolutionary view of starting from what you know, then using your inner created pictures, followed by exercises based on the rhythm and melody of a language will create a firm foundation for your language learning practice. You will become an autonomous language learner and improve your knowledge of foreign languages &#8211; or even decide to learn new ones as well!Based on the techniques of famous and classical polyglots like Kat? Lomb, Heinrich Schliemann and Giuseppe Mezzofanti, the author develops a widely practicable technique for those who like reading </p>

<p>Summary : In this fierce essay, leading Bible scholar Scot McKnight tells the story of Junia, a female apostle honored by Paul in his Letter to the Romans&#8211;and then silenced and forgotten for most of church history. But Junia&#8217;s tragedy is not hers alone. She&#8217;s joined by fellow women in the Bible whose stories of bold leadership have been overlooked. She&#8217;s in the company of visionary women of God throughout the centuries whose names we&#8217;ve forgotten, whose stories go untold, and whose witness we neglect to celebrate.But Junia is also joined by women today&#8211;women who are no longer silent and who are experiencing a re-voicing as they respond to God&#8217;s call to lead us into all truth.

<p>Summary : Maguire is bad luck.No matter how many charms she buys off the internet or good luck rituals she performs each morning, horrible things happen when Maguire is around. Like that time the roller coaster jumped off its tracks. Or the time the house next door caught on fire. Or that time her brother, father, and uncle were all killed in a car crash?and Maguire walked away with barely a scratch.It?s safest for Maguire to hide out in her room, where she can cause less damage and avoid new people who she could hurt. But then she meets Jordy, an aspiring tennis star. Jordy is confident, talented, and lucky, and he?s convinced he can help Maguire break her unlucky streak. Maguire knows that the best thing she can do for Jordy is to stay away. But it turns out staying away may be harder than she thought.</p>

<p>Summary : The shadows have risen, and the line is law. All Bree wanted was to uncover the truth behind her mother?s death. So she infiltrated the Legendborn Order, a secret society descended from King Arthur?s knights?only to discover her own ancestral power. Now, Bree has become someone new: A Medium. A Bloodcrafter. A Scion. But the ancient war between demons and the Order is rising to a deadly peak. And Nick, the Legendborn boy Bree fell in love with, has been kidnapped. Bree wants to fight, but the Regents who rule the Order won?t let her. To them, she is an unknown girl with unheard-of power, and as the living anchor for the spell that preserves the Legendborn cycle, she must be protected. When the Regents reveal they will do whatever it takes to hide the war, Bree and her friends must go on the run to rescue Nick themselves. But enemies are everywhere, Bree?s powers are unpredictable and dangerous, and she can?t escape her growing attraction to Selwyn, the mage sworn to protect Nick </p>

<p>Summary : Preparing a first-class cocktail relies upon a deep understanding of its ingredients, the delicate alchemy of how they work together?their flavor, aroma and color. Most of all, mixing a sublime cocktail is an art.In The Curious Bartender, the mastermind behind three of London?s most avant-garde cocktail bars Tristan Stephenson explores and experiments with the art of preparing the perfect cocktail, explaining the fascinating modern turns mixology has taken. Showcasing a selection of classic cocktails, Tristan explains their intriguing origins, introducing the colorful characters who inspired or created them and how they were intertwined within their historical context. Moving on, he reinvents each drink from his laboratory, adding contemporary twists to breathe fresh life into these vintage classics. Stay true to the originals with a Sazerac or a Rob Roy, or experiment with some of his modern variations to create a Green Fairy Sazerac topped with an absinthe ?air? or an Insta-age Rob </p>

<p>Summary : Who?s really behind America?s appetite for foods from around the globe? This group biography from an electric new voice in food writing honors seven extraordinary women, all immigrants, who left an indelible mark on the way Americans eat today. Taste Makers stretches from World War II to the present, with absorbing and deeply researched portraits of figures including Mexican-born Elena Zelayeta, a blind chef; Marcella Hazan, the deity of Italian cuisine; and Norma Shirley, a champion of Jamaican dishes.In imaginative, lively prose, Mayukh Sen?a queer, brown child of immigrants?reconstructs the lives of these women in vivid and empathetic detail, daring to ask why some were famous in their own time, but not in ours, and why others shine brightly even today. Weaving together histories of food, immigration, and gender, Taste Makers will challenge the way readers look at what?s on their plate?and the women whose labor, overlooked for so long, makes those meals possible.</p>

<p>Summary : A startlingly beautiful story of a family&#8217;s survival, The End We Start From is a haunting but hopeful dystopian vision of a familiar world made dangerous and unstable.Megan Hunter&#8217;s honed and spare prose paints an imagined future as realistic as it is frightening. Though the country is falling apart around them and its people are forced to become refugees, this family?s world ? of new life and new hope ? sings with love.In the midst of a mysterious environmental crisis, as London is submerged below flood waters, a woman gives birth to her first child. Days later, the family are forced to leave their home in search of safety. As they move from place to place, shelter to shelter, their journey traces both fear and wonder as the baby&#8217;s small fists grasp at the things he sees, as he grows and stretches, thriving and content against all the odds.With Benedict Cumberbatch calling it ?a stunning tale of motherhood?, film rights have been sold to his production company SunnyMarch.</p>

I?m not sure.Only as more time passes, I?m worried I?ll never learn fact from fiction.It?s why I?m taking my place within our brotherhood.Not out of obligation, but as a cover to get what I desperately need.The truth.The only thing standing in my way?A six-foot asshole in Armani with sapphire eyes and a heart of ice and stone.He despises me on principle alone.He?s a distraction I crave but can?t afford.Yet I doubt the hatred he carries is actually for me.Which makes me want to melt his cold, callous demeanor more.And when I catch a glimpse beneath the surface,I find I?m not the only one searching for answers to unspoken questions.Or keeping secrets.**These Vile Secrets is an Discover the Bestseller Everyone is Talking About: Read These Vile Secrets (Enclave, #1) PDF , Reading These Vile Secrets (Enclave, #1) pdf , These Vile Secrets (Enclave, #1) Handbook , These Vile Secrets (Enclave, #1) read , These Vile Secrets (Enclave, #1) epub , These Vile Secrets (Enclave, #1) in English , These Vile Secrets (Enclave, #1) Kindle , These Vile Secrets (Enclave, #1) audiobook These Vile Secrets (Enclave, #1) Summary.

<p>Summary : A manifesto to change how you eat and how you think about the human body.It?s not you, it?s the food.We have entered a new age of eating. For the first time in human history, most of our calories come from an entirely novel set of substances called Ultra-Processed Food.

I?m terrified someone will be harmed, so I need Mitchell to come back and help me guide them. He and I are capable of instructing the omegas successfully?if we can stop fighting long enough to partner together.If we do this, will my heart survive being close </p>

<p>Summary : From the New York Times bestselling author of Chasing the Scream: The First and Last Days of the War on Drugs, a startling challenge to our thinking about depression and anxiety.Award-winning journalist Johann Hari suffered from depression since he was a child and started taking antidepressants when he was a teenager. He was told?like his entire generation?that his problem was caused by a chemical imbalance in his brain. As an adult, trained in the social sciences, he began to investigate this question?and he learned that almost everything we have been told about depression and anxiety is wrong. Across the world, Hari discovered social scientists who were uncovering the real causes?and they are mostly not in our brains, but in the way we live today. Hari?s journey took him from the people living in the tunnels beneath Las Vegas, to an Amish community in Indiana, to an uprising in Berlin?all showing in vivid and dramatic detail these new insights.

<p>Summary : Segunda entrega de los imprescindibles diarios de Rafael Chirbes, que deslumbran por su lucidez, honestidad y desgarro.Son los a?os de la lenta gestaci?n, llena de dudas que lo llevan incluso a plantearse abandonar la literatura, de la novela que le supondr?a la consagraci?n definitiva: Crematorio. Son tambi?n a?os de incertidumbres personales: del abandono definitivo de su trabajo en la redacci?n de Sobremesa, que le da una nueva libertad; de amigos que fallecen; de fugaces encuentros sexuales, entre el deseo y la decrepitud, porque el cuerpo ya no es joven; de crecientes desenga?os&#8230; Pero siguen muy vivos los entusiasmos de siempre; las pel?culas cl?sicas que traen momentos de felicidad y las lecturas incansables, sagaces y variopintas: Montaigne, La Celestina, La Regenta, Baudelaire, los cuentos de Poe, la Suite francesa de N?mirovsky, los diarios de J?nger, Ellroy&#8230; Y tambi?n los viajes a varias ciudades: Nueva York, Berl?n, Par?s, Barcelona&#8230;</p>

<p>Summary : I&#8217;m Not Leaving ? Rwanda through the eyes of the only American to remain in the country throughout the 1994 genocide.Wilkens writes:It must have been about the 2nd week of the genocide that I got the idea of talking on a cassette recorder, to record what was happening around me. I honestly did not know if I was going to survive this dark time, and if I didn&#8217;t survive I wanted to leave something for my wife and our three children. I always scribbled our home address in Spokane, Washington on each tape in the hope that if something did happen to me and our home here was looted, some kind person might find these tapes and send them to their intended destination. The vast majority of this book is based on those tapes, about eight hours of recordings.</p>

Il volume si pone come un piccolo dizionario-vademecum, un utile manuale che introduce al mondo dell&#8217;arte di XX secolo, risultando un utile strumento di conoscenza per gli appassionati di arte contemporanea e il grande pubblico.</p>

<p>Summary : In 2013, Kate Greene moved to Mars. That is, along with five fellow crew members, she embarked on NASA?s first HI-SEAS mission, a simulated Martian environment located on the slopes of Mauna Loa in Hawai&#8217;i. For four months she lived, worked, and slept in an isolated geodesic dome, conducting a sleep study on her crew mates and gained insight into human behavior in tight quarters, as well as the nature of boredom, dreams, and isolation that arise amidst the promise of scientific progress and glory.The book is a story of the author, a science journalist and her personal life, her brother?s disability, her marriage and the food and isolation of pretending to live on Mars.</p>
