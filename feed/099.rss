<p>Summary : A new American classic from the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Gilead and Housekeeping. Marilynne Robinson, one of the greatest novelists of our time, returns to the town of Gilead in an unforgettable story of a girlhood lived on the fringes of society in fear, awe, and wonder.Lila, homeless and alone after years of roaming the countryside, steps inside a small-town Iowa church &#8211; the only available shelter from the rain &#8211; and ignites a romance and a debate that will reshape her life.

<p>Summary : After being abandoned as a child, Ada has learned to choose her friends and lovers wisely. And then a nuclear winter froze the world, taking everything she fought so hard to keep. When she inexplicably wakes years later in a new world full of magic, and where humans are the enemy, all she wants is to find her two best friends&#8230; if they?re even alive. Jasper knows he is someone damaged and dangerous, the scars on his body prove it. But his memories have been taken from him. He knows not why, or how, he came to be in the locked room with the pretty, vulnerable human, but he knows three things: the King wants him dead, Ada is his mate, and he?ll do anything to claim her.Trusting each other is their first step to uncovering the truth and avoiding certain death. But how can Ada feel safe with a strange fae who keeps dark secrets one minute, and then stokes the flames of her desire the next? How can she forgive the broken fae for hiding the most precious secret of all ? his heart.The </p>

<p>Summary : From YouTube Star Anna Akana comes a collection of personal essays about everything from self-esteem and friendship to sex and career decisions.  In 2007, Anna Akana lost her teen sister, Kristina, to suicide. In the years that followed, Anna realized that the one thing that helped her process her grief and begin to heal was comedy. So, she turned to stand-up comedy and YouTube as a form of creative expression. Now she relays the hard-won advice she herself could have used when she was younger. Tackling everything from falling in love to becoming financially independent to staying safe on the Internet, she opens up about mistakes she made when she was a teenager and what young women everywhere can learn from her.</p>

<p>Summary : From YouTube Star Anna Akana comes a collection of personal essays about everything from self-esteem and friendship to sex and career decisions.  In 2007, Anna Akana lost her teen sister, Kristina, to suicide. In the years that followed, Anna realized that the one thing that helped her process her grief and begin to heal was comedy. So, she turned to stand-up comedy and YouTube as a form of creative expression. Now she relays the hard-won advice she herself could have used when she was younger. Tackling everything from falling in love to becoming financially independent to staying safe on the Internet, she opens up about mistakes she made when she was a teenager and what young women everywhere can learn from her.</p>

<p>Summary : NATIONAL BESTSELLERFrom the former Governor of the Bank of Canada, a far-seeing guide to the powerful economic forces that will shape the decades ahead.The economic ground is shifting beneath our feet. The world is becoming more volatile, and people are understandably worried about their financial futures. In this urgent and accessible guide to the crises and opportunities that lie ahead, economist and former Governor of the Bank of Canada Stephen Poloz maps out the powerful tectonic forces that are shaping our future, and the ideas that will allow us to master them.These forces include an aging workforce, mounting debt, and rising income inequality. Technological advances, too, are adding to the pressure, putting people out of work, and climate change is forcing a transition to a lower-carbon economy. It is no surprise that people are feeling uncertain.The implications of these tectonic tensions will cascade throughout every dimension of our lives&#8211;the job market, the housing </p>

<p>Summary : The global history of oil politics, from World War I to the present, can teach us much about world politics, climate change, and international order in the twenty-first century.When and why does international order change? The largest peaceful transfer of wealth across borders in all of human history began with the oil crisis of 1973. OPEC countries turned the tables on the most powerful businesses on the planet, quadrupling the price of oil and shifting the globaldistribution of profits. It represented a huge shift in international order. Yet, the textbook explanation for how world politics works-that the most powerful country sets up and sustains the rules of international order after winning a major war-doesn&#8217;t fit these events, or plenty of others.Instead of thinking of the international order as a single thing, Jeff Colgan explains how it operates in parts, and often changes in peacetime. Partial Hegemony offers lessons for leaders and analysts seeking to design new </p>

<p>Summary : To commemorate the bi-centenary of the War of 1812, Anchor Canada brings together Pierre Berton&#8217;s two groundbreaking books on the subject. The Invasion of Canada is a remarkable account of the war&#8217;s first year and the events that led up to it; Pierre Berton transforms history into an engrossing narrative that reads like a fast-paced novel. Drawing on personal memoirs and diaries as well as official dispatches, the author has been able to get inside the characters of the men who fought the war &#8211; the common soldiers as well as the generals, the bureaucrats and the profiteers, the traitors and the loyalists. The Canada-U.S. border was in flames as the War of 1812 continued. York&#8217;s parliament buildings were on fire, Niagara-on-the-Lake burned to the ground and Buffalo lay in ashes. Even the American capital of Washington, far to the south, was put to the torch. The War of 1812 had become one of the nineteenth century&#8217;s bloodiest struggles.Flames Across the Border is a compelling </p>

<p>Summary : Nellie Rivera is trading traffic for tranquility. When the quiet streets of small-town Montana beckon, she leaves Denver behind and moves to Calamity. It would be the perfect adventure if not for Cal Stark.When her archnemesis dares to show his face one Saturday morning, declaring he is moving there too, she vows to make his life a misery. The town isn?t big enough for the both of them and besides . . .She was here first.Cal has been a thorn in her side since high school. He might have bullied her back then, but she?s not a modest teenager anymore and has learned a few plays of her own. If all goes to plan, she?ll run the former pro quarterback out of town within a month.There?s only one problem. Cal has the same plan. He wants Calamity bad enough to pull out all the stops. And after one kiss, she realizes that he doesn?t play fair.</p>

<p>Summary : As the market-leading textbook on the subject, Project Management: The Managerial Process, 5e is distinguished by its balanced treatment of both the technical and behavioral issues in project management as well as by its coverage of a broad range of industries to which project management principles can be applied. It focuses on how project management is integral to the organization as a whole. The 5th edition reflects the latest changes found in the practice. Other texts discuss the topics covered in this text but they do not view oversight as the project manager&#8217;s operating environment, as does Larson/Gray. Resumes of managers will soon be primarily a description of participation in and contributions to projects.</p>

<p>Summary : As the market-leading textbook on the subject, Project Management: The Managerial Process, 5e is distinguished by its balanced treatment of both the technical and behavioral issues in project management as well as by its coverage of a broad range of industries to which project management principles can be applied. It focuses on how project management is integral to the organization as a whole. The 5th edition reflects the latest changes found in the practice. Other texts discuss the topics covered in this text but they do not view oversight as the project manager&#8217;s operating environment, as does Larson/Gray. Resumes of managers will soon be primarily a description of participation in and contributions to projects.</p>

<p>Summary : India is widely recognized as a new global powerhouse. It has become one of the world&#8217;s emerging powers, rivaling China in terms of global influence. Yet people still know relatively little about the economic, social, political, and cultural changes unfolding in India today. To what extent are people benefiting from the economic boom? Does caste still exist in India? How is India&#8217;s culture industry responding to technological change? And what of India&#8217;s rapidly changing role internationally?This Very Short Introduction looks at the exciting world of change in contemporary India. Craig Jeffrey provides a compelling account of the recent history of the nation, investigating the contradictions that are plaguing modern India and the manner in which people, especially young people, are actively remaking the country in the twenty first century. One thing is clear: India is a country that is going to become increasingly important for the world over the coming decades.ABOUT THE SERIES The </p>

<p>Summary : Both Muslims and non-Muslims see women in most Muslim countries as suffering from social, economic, and political discrimination, treated by law and society as second-class citizens subject to male authority. This discrimination is attributed to Islam and Islamic law, and since the late 19th century there has been a mass of literature tackling this issue.Recently, exciting new feminist research has been challenging gender discrimination and male authority from within Islamic legal this book presents some important results from that research. The contributors all engage critically with two central juristic concepts; rooted in the Qur?an, they lie at the basis of this discrimination.

<p>Summary : Both Muslims and non-Muslims see women in most Muslim countries as suffering from social, economic, and political discrimination, treated by law and society as second-class citizens subject to male authority.

The contributors all engage critically with two central juristic concepts; rooted in the Qur?an, they lie at the basis of this discrimination. One refers to a husband?s authority over his wife, his financial responsibility toward her, and his superior status and rights. The other is male family members? right and duty of guardianship over female members (e.g., fathers over daughters when entering into marriage contracts) and the privileging of </p>

<p>Summary : The People of Plato is the first study since 1823 devoted exclusively to the identification of, and relationships among, the individuals represented in the complete Platonic corpus. It provides details of their lives, and it enables one to consider the persons of Plato&#8217;s works, and those of other Socratics, within a nexus of important political, social, and familial relationships.Debra Nails makes a broad spectrum of scholarship accessible to the non-specialist. She distinguishes what can be stated confidently from what remains controversial and&#8211;with full references to ancient and contemporary sources&#8211;advances our knowledge of the men and women of the Socratic milieu.Bringing the results of modern epigraphical and papyrological research to bear on long-standing questions, The People of Plato is a fascinating resource and valuable research tool for the field of ancient Greek philosophy and for literary, political, and historical studies more generally.In discrete sections, Nails </p>

<p>Summary : Darrow would have lived in peace, but his enemies brought him war. The Gold overlords demanded his obedience, hanged his wife, and enslaved his people. But Darrow is determined to fight back. Risking everything to transform himself and breach Gold society, Darrow has battled to survive the cutthroat rivalries that breed Society?s mightiest warriors, climbed the ranks, and waited patiently to unleash the revolution that will tear the hierarchy apart from within. Finally, the time has come. But devotion to honor and hunger for vengeance run deep on both sides. Darrow and his comrades-in-arms face powerful enemies without scruple or mercy. Among them are some Darrow once considered friends. To win, Darrow will need to inspire those shackled in darkness to break their chains, unmake the world their cruel masters have built, and claim a destiny too long denied?and too glorious to surrender.</p>

<p>Summary : Terra preta is the Portuguese name of a type of soil which is thought to have almost miraculous properties. The newspapers are flooded with reports about ?black gold,? scientists believe that two of the greatest problems facing the world ? climate change and the hunger crisis ? can be solved by it. The beauty of it is that everyone can do something about it because since 2005 the secret of producing this black soil has been revealed ? and it is a secret that seemed to have been lost forever with the downfall of the once thriving Indian culture of the Amazon basin. The recipe is astonishingly simple as all you need are kitchen or garden wastes, charcoal and earthworms, so it can be produced on every balcony or on the smallest of garden plots.The authors set off on a treasure hunt and condensed all the knowledge about the world?s most fertile soil into a convenient guidebook.

Every day, while her immigrant parents clean the rooms, ten-year-old Mia manages the front desk of the Calivista Motel and tends to its guests.Number 2: Her parents hide immigrants.

As Alan and Barry test the limits of their strange gifts inside the military complex known as Dreamland, Jennifer and Timika begin a quest to locate an ancient tablet that may hold the answers to humanity&#8217;s greatest question.Are we alone in the </p>

<p>Summary : A full-color, lushly illustrated graphic novel that recounts the many-layered past and present of beer through dynamic pairings of pictures and meticulously researched insight into the history of the world&#8217;s favorite brew.Starting from about 7,000 BC,?The Comic Book Story of Beer traces beer&#8217;s influence through world history, encapsulating early man&#8217;s experiments with fermentation, the rise and fall of Ancient Rome, the (often beer-related) factors that led Europe out of the Dark Ages, the Age of Exploration, the spread of capitalism, the Reformation, and on up to the contemporary explosion of craft brewing. No book has ever told the story of beer in a graphic format as a liberating or emancipating force that improved the life of everyday people. Visually riffing on abstract subjects like pasteurization, &#8220;original gravity,&#8221; and &#8220;lagering,&#8221; artist Aaron McConnell has a flair for cinematic action and demonstrates versatility in depicting characters and episodes from beer&#8217;s rich </p>

Visually riffing on abstract subjects like pasteurization, &amp;#8220;original gravity,&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;lagering,&amp;#8221; artist Aaron McConnell has a flair for cinematic action and demonstrates versatility in depicting characters and episodes from beer&amp;#8217;s rich Discover the Bestseller Everyone is Talking About: Read The Comic Book Story of Beer: The World&amp;#8217;s Favorite Beverage from 7000 BC to Today&amp;#8217;s Craft Brewing Revolution PDF , Reading The Comic Book Story of Beer: The World&amp;#8217;s Favorite Beverage from 7000 BC to Today&amp;#8217;s Craft Brewing Revolution pdf , The Comic Book Story of Beer: The World&amp;#8217;s Favorite Beverage from 7000 BC to Today&amp;#8217;s Craft Brewing Revolution Handbook , The Comic Book Story of Beer: The World&amp;#8217;s Favorite Beverage from 7000 BC to Today&amp;#8217;s Craft Brewing Revolution read , The Comic Book Story of Beer: The World&amp;#8217;s Favorite Beverage from 7000 BC to Today&amp;#8217;s Craft Brewing Revolution epub , The Comic Book Story of Beer: The World&amp;#8217;s Favorite Beverage from 7000 BC to Today&amp;#8217;s Craft Brewing Revolution in English , The Comic Book Story of Beer: The World&amp;#8217;s Favorite Beverage from 7000 BC to Today&amp;#8217;s Craft Brewing Revolution Kindle , The Comic Book Story of Beer: The World&amp;#8217;s Favorite Beverage from 7000 BC to Today&amp;#8217;s Craft Brewing Revolution audiobook The Comic Book Story of Beer: The World&amp;#8217;s Favorite Beverage from 7000 BC to Today&amp;#8217;s Craft Brewing Revolution Summary.

<p>Summary : An electrifying introduction to complexity theory, the science of how complex systems behave?from cells to human beings, ecosystems, the known universe and beyond?that profoundly reframes our understanding and illuminates our interconnectedness.Nothing in the universe is more complex than life. Throughout the skies, in oceans, and across lands, life is endlessly on the move. In its myriad forms?from cells to human beings, social structures, and ecosystems&#8211;life is open-ended, evolving, unpredictable, yet adaptive and self-sustaining. Complexity theory addresses the mysteries that animate science, philosophy, and metaphysics: how this teeming array of existence, from the infinitesimal to the infinite, is in fact a seamless living whole and what our place, as conscious beings, is within it.

I&#8217;ve been dreading this reunion since we graduated high school ten years ago.So why am I here, standing outside the door like the eternal wallflower I am?I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s because my younger sister browbeat me into it, but the truth is, I&#8217;m tired of being a nobody. Of never taking a risk with myself and my life.And&#8230;well&#8230;maybe I&#8217;m also hoping to see him.The tall, insanely gorgeous man walking my way now.

<p>Summary : Anche in Italia il divorzio ? diventato una piaga sociale che compromette pesantemente la coesione e la struttura della societ? oltre che impattare negativamente sulla sfera patrimoniale, professionale e sociale dei poveri padri, vittime di una conclamata truffa femminista, in cui gli unici a vincere e prosperare sono purtroppo solo gli avvocati e gli unici a perdere sono i figli. Il matrimonio sta fallendo nella sua storica funzione sociale proprio perch? nel frattempo si ? fatto il possibile per incensare ed assecondare le aberranti richieste nazifemministe, tanto da mettere al bando ed emarginare la famiglia tradizionale. Chi si sposa in Italia in questo momento ha il 70% di possibilit? di andare in default entro il terzo anno: ci si sposa pensando che tanto sar? amore per sempre. Solo dopo aver acceso la luce rossa ed essere entrati nel tunnel ci si rende conto cosa significa divorziare. L&#8217;illusione regna sovrana soprattutto tra i maschi, pensando che sia facile e possibile </p>

<p>Summary : She&#8217;d failed them. All of them. And now she was paying the price.Kiva thought she knew what she wanted&#8211;revenge. But feelings change, people change . . . everything has changed.After what happened at the palace, Kiva is desperate to know if her friends and family are safe, and whether those she wronged can ever forgive her. But with the kingdoms closer to the brink of war than they&#8217;ve ever been, and Kiva far away from the conflict, more is at stake than her own broken heart.A fresh start will mean a perilous quest, forcing mortal enemies and uneasy allies together in a race against the clock to save not just Evalon, but all of Wenderall. With her loyalties now set, Kiva can no longer just survive&#8211;she must fight for what she believes in. For who she believes in. But with danger coming from every side, and the lives of everyone she loves at risk, does she have what it takes to stand, or will she fall?</p>

El autor contrasta las vivencias de un adolescente con las reflexiones de adultos que vivieron la misma experiencia. La idea es que se vea frente al espejo de quienes pasaron antes para evitar la ansiedad de una etapa dificil y compleja, pero no menos emocionante.</p>

When events in the Barrett household explode in tragedy, the show and the shocking incidents it captures become the stuff of urban legend.Fifteen years later, a bestselling writer interviews Marjorie&#8217;s younger sister, </p>

<p>Summary : Carpathians are an immortal race of beings with animal instincts. Every Carpathian male is drawn to his life mate: a Carpathian or human female able to provide the light to his darkness. Without her, the beast within slowly consumes the man until turning vampire is the only option. Raven Whitney is a psychic who has used her gift to help the police track down a serial killer. Now she is determined to escape the glare of recent publicity for the peace and quiet of the Carpathian Mountains. Prince Mikhail Dubrinsky is the leader of his people but, as his ancient Carpathian race grows ever closer to extinction, he is close to giving in to the heavy weight of loneliness and despair. From the moment their minds touch, Raven and Mikhail form a connection. But there are those who incorrectly view all Carpathians as vampires, and are determined to give their extinction a helping hand.There is an extended edition with an additional 100 pages: Dark Prince: Author&#8217;s Cut Special Edition.</p>

<p>Summary : I Believe Jesus Will Return &#8230;What More Do I Need to Know? Do you tend to avoid studying books of the Bible like Revelation and Ezekiel? Does it feel like words such as rapture and apocalypse fly right over your head? It&#8217;s common to dismiss these and other topics related to Bible prophecy as irrelevant and&#8230;well&#8230;too complicated.But God&#8217;s Word says, &#8220;Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it, because the time is near&#8221; (Revelation 1:3).Prepare to be blessed in an entertaining and meaningful way! The Non-Prophet&#8217;s Guide to the End Times combines engaging illustrations with down-to-earth explanations to help you navigate the ins and outs of Bible prophecy. There&#8217;s no better time to grasp God&#8217;s plans for the future?and for you?than this very moment.</p>

<p>Summary : A SPACE SALVAGER AND HER PARTNER MAKE THE DISCOVERY OF A LIFETIME THAT JUST MIGHT CHANGE THE UNIVERSE IN THIS WILD, BIG-IDEAS SPACE OPERA FROM AWARD-WINNING AUTHOR ELIZABETH BEAR.Halmey Dz and her partner Connla Kurucz are salvage operators, living just on the inside of the law&#8230;usually. Theirs is the perilous and marginal existence?with barely enough chance of striking it fantastically big?just once?to keep them coming back for more. They pilot their tiny ship into the scars left by unsuccessful White Transitions, searching for the relics of lost human and alien vessels. But when they make a shocking discovery about an alien species that has been long thought dead, it may be the thing that could tip the perilous peace mankind has found into full-out war.Energetic and electrifying, &#8216;ANCESTRAL NIGHT&#8217; is a dazzling space opera, sure to delight fans of Alastair Reynolds, Iain M. Banks, and Peter F. Hamilton.RUNNING TIME =&gt; 16hrs. and 48mins.?2019 Elizabeth Bear (P)2019 Simon &amp; </p>

<p>Summary : On the streets of New Orleans, sins are committed every night.My name is Jett Colby and I save tarnished souls. In the downtown, under the glittery lights of Bourbon Street, I found her in cheap lingerie, flaunting her body for callous men and money. From the lace of her cheap lingerie, to her garter belt, I knew she had to be saved.She had to be mine.Broke and destitute with no way of out, she had no choice but to come to me and into my club. She had no other choice but to become a Jett Girl. But see, that?s the thing about this city; you might think that under the dazzling lights and illusion of salvation, she?s the one that needed saving.When the glitter fades and the dirt is washed away, the one worth saving just might be me.**FORMALLY BECOMING A JETT GIRL**</p>

<p>Summary : ????Vampires are the most fearsome and fascinating of all creatures of folklore. For the first time, detailed accounts of the vampire and how its tradition developed in different cultures are gathered in one volume by eminent folklorist Alan Dundes. Eleven leading scholars from the fields of Slavic studies, history, anthropology, and psychiatry unearth the true nature of the vampire from its birth in graveyard lore to the modern-day psychiatric patient with a penchant for drinking blood.????The Vampire: A Casebook takes this legend out of the realm of literature and film and back to its dark beginnings in folk traditions. The essays examine the history of the word ?vampire;? Romanian vampires; Greek vampires; Serbian vampires; the physical attributes of vampires; the killing of vampires; and the possible psychoanalytic underpinnings of vampires. Much more than simply a scary creature of the human imagination, the vampire has been and continues to haunt the lives of all those who </p>

<p>Summary : Very few Catholic writers indeed can touch the minds and hearts of all Catholics?whatever their back-ground?and Fr. Paul O&#8217;Sullivan happens to be one of these rare few. In How to Be Happy?How to Be Holy, Fr. O&#8217;Sullivan teaches all Christians about prayer: I ) how to pray. 2) how to derive immense benefits from prayer, and 3) how to enjoy the deep consolation of prayer. In the process, he focuses first on the profound meanings of our basic Catholic prayers: The Sign of the Cross, The Our Father, The Hail Mary, The Glory Be, The Apostles? Creed, The Morning Offering, The Confiteor, etc. Next follows a full and beautiful explanation of the Rosary&#8217; and each of its Mysteries. Then he paints the wonders of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, and finally he concludes on the power of ejaculations and the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary.The most beautiful aspect of this consoling and moving book?as in fact of all Fr. O?Sullivan?s writings?is his frequent use of lovely, short anecdotes from the lives </p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  &#8220;An utterly unique journey down some of the mind&#8217;s more mysterious byways . . . ranges from the shocking to the simply lovely.&#8221; ?Marya Hornbacher <br />
Stacy Pershall grew up depressed and too smart for her own good, a deeply strange girl in Prairie Grove, Arkansas (population 1,000), where the prevailing wisdom was that Jesus healed all. From her days as a thirteen-year-old Jesus freak, through a battle with anorexia and bulimia, her first manic episode at eighteen, and the eventual diagnosis of bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder, this spirited and at times mordantly funny memoir chronicles Pershall&#8217;s journey through hell-several breakdowns and suicide attempts?and her struggle with the mental health care system.

She found a revolutionary cure (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy) and a new mood-stabilizing medication. She also met a tattoo artist and </p>

<p>Summary : Everything Handmaids wear is red: the colour of blood, which defines us.Offred is a Handmaid in the Republic of Gilead, where women are prohibited from holding jobs, reading, and forming friendships. She serves in the household of the Commander and his wife, and under the new social order she has only one purpose: once a month, she must lie on her back and pray that the Commander makes her pregnant, because in an age of declining births, Offred and the other Handmaids are valued only if they are fertile. But Offred remembers the years before Gilead, when she was an independent woman who had a job, a family, and a name of her own. Now, her memories and her will to survive are acts of rebellion.Provocative, startling, prophetic, The Handmaid&#8217;s Tale has long been a global phenomenon. With this stunning graphic novel adaptation of Margaret Atwood&#8217;s modern classic, beautifully realized by artist Ren?e Nault, the terrifying reality of Gilead has been brought to vivid life like never before.</p>

<p>Summary : After a year of laborious solitude and a conflict brought to the doorstep of his father&#8217;s house, Jak, a Southlander of meek circumstance, will come to accept the future isn&#8217;t set. Through abilities unnerving to any Areht, against enemies rising in every corner of the planet, he?ll be forced to resolve his destiny as one of five that can change the world. Such selfless transcendence isn?t easy, nor simply the heroic result of dark revelations shielded from him since childhood now exposed; rather, it&#8217;s because of what?s undeniable, even to him. Like all great forces collected at the tip of the spear, the truth of his purpose and the price of his existence has a cost and there&#8217;s no getting around paying it.</p>

Through abilities unnerving to any Areht, against enemies rising in every corner of the planet, he?ll be forced to resolve his destiny as one of five that can change the world. Such selfless transcendence isn?t easy, nor simply the heroic result of dark revelations shielded from him since childhood now exposed; rather, it&#8217;s because of what?s undeniable, even to him. Like all great forces collected at the tip of the spear, the truth of his purpose and the price of his existence has a cost and there&#8217;s no getting around paying it.</p>

<p>Summary : I had no idea crashing into a ditch would change my life forever. Fate had other plans, and I never stood a chance.A series of weather and road mishaps left me trapped in the middle of a blizzard with a complete stranger in the back of a pickup truck. For forty-eight freakin&#8217; hours.A stranger with long hair, tattoos, and rippling with muscle. A stranger with an insanely sexy voice and a smile that turned my insides to jelly. A stranger who held me in his arms, calmed me, and then set a fire in me that I couldn&#8217;t put out.I didn&#8217;t know I was trapped with America&#8217;s favorite bad boy guitarist, Storm Valentine. And he was in no rush to reveal his secret. He&#8217;s used to getting everything he wants, and for some reason, he&#8217;s decided he wants me.Some people chase storms for the beautiful thrill. What happens when the storm chases you?</p>

<p>Summary : What would the world be like if 80 percent of the population manifested superpowers called ?Quirks?? Heroes and villains would be battling it out everywhere! Being a hero would mean learning to use your power, but where would you go to study? The Hero Academy of course! But what would you do if you were one of the 20 percent who were born Quirkless?Since the terrifying incident when Tomura?s Quirk manifested, only the greatest villain of them all, All For One, has been able to speak to the broken young boy?s heart. The consequences of that fateful meeting play out in the present as Tomura and Re-Destro, the leader of the Meta Liberation Army, battle for supremacy?and if it takes leveling a whole city to sort out who?s on top, so be it!</p>

<p>Summary : Achille Mbembe is one of the world&#8217;s most profound critics of colonialism and its consequences, a major figure in the emergence of a new wave of French critical theory. His writings examine the complexities of decolonization for African subjectivities and the possibilities emerging in its wake. In Out of the Great Darkness, he offers a rich analysis of the paradoxes of the postcolonial moment that points toward new liberatory models of community and humanity.In a nuanced consideration of the African experience, Mbembe makes sweeping interventions into debates about citizenship, identity, democracy, and modernity. He eruditely ranges across European and African thought to provide a powerful assessment of common ways of writing and thinking about Africa. Mbembe criticizes the blinders of European intellectuals, analyzing France&#8217;s failure to heed postcolonial critiques of ongoing exclusions masked by pretenses of universalism. He develops a new reading of African modernity that further </p>

He eruditely ranges across European and African thought to provide a powerful assessment of common ways of writing and thinking about Africa.

<p>Summary : Lobo, el protagonista de esta novela fascinante sobre la vida en la frontera de M?xico con los Estados Unidos, no posee educaci?n pero le sobra talento para convertir los sucesos notables en baladas ?picas. Cuando el cabecilla de una banda local de narc?ticos topa con ?l, Lobo se convierte en el juglar del reino. A trav?s de sus canciones, describe la vida tanto dentro de la corte como fuera de ella, y aunque al principio sus composiciones sirven para glorificar y popularizar el cartel, juegan a la larga un papel integral en su desaparici?n. Con su lenguaje l?rico y popular, Trabajos del reino es un retrato v?vido de un mundo de arrabales, cantinas, prost?bulos, drogas, armas y muerte que no dejar? de afectar a ning?n lector.</p>

<p>Summary : Japanese erotic art, shunga, has a long history, with thousands of paintings, prints, and illustrated books produced, mostly from the seventeenth to late nineteenth centuries. Shunga literally means ?picture of spring???spring? being a common Japanese euphemism for sex?and the works celebrate all facets of human sexuality with great candor.Unlike earlier books that have tended to focus on individual artists, this new publication has a thematic structure, covering the whole spectrum of sexual practice and expression, including adultery and jealousy, voyeurism, orgasm, and violent sex and death. Using images from his own unparalleled collection, Ofer Shagan brings the rich and vast world of shunga to modern view, highlighting the messages, symbols, and humor that often appear in the background but are fundamentally significant for understanding the messages in the art.</p>

Shunga literally means ?picture of spring???spring? being a common Japanese euphemism for sex?and the works celebrate all facets of human sexuality with great candor.Unlike earlier books that have tended to focus on individual artists, this new publication has a thematic structure, covering the whole spectrum of sexual practice and expression, including adultery and jealousy, voyeurism, orgasm, and violent sex and death. Using images from his own unparalleled collection, Ofer Shagan brings the rich and vast world of shunga to modern view, highlighting the messages, symbols, and humor that often appear in the background but are fundamentally significant for understanding the messages in the art.

<p>Summary : Growing Up Jewish in India offers an historical account of the primary Jewish communities of India, their synagogues, and unique Indian Jewish customs. It offers an investigation both within Jewish India and beyond its borders, tracing how Jews arrived in the vast subcontinent at different times from different places and have both inhabited dispersed locations within the larger Indian world, and ultimately created their own diaspora within the larger Jewish diaspora by relocating to other countries, particularly Israel and the United States.The text and its rich complement of over 150 images explore how Indian Jews retained their unique characteristics as Jews, became well-integrated into the larger society of India as Indians, and have continued to offer a synthesis of cultural qualities wherever they reside. Among the outcomes of these developments is the unique art of Siona Benjamin, who grew up in the Bene Israel community of Mumbai and then moved to the US, and whose art </p>

<p>Summary : In the stunning conclusion to the Elements of Cadence duology, A Fire Endless finds the delicate balance between the human and faerie realm threatened by Bane, the spirit of the North Wind, whose defeat can only come through fire, song, and heart-rending sacrifice.East and West. Humans and Spirits. Breccans and Tamerlaines. The Isle of Cadence has always held itself and its residents in a tenuous balance. But now Bane, the spirit of the North Wind, has pushed everyone and everything in his path off-kilter in a bid to claim dominion over all.In the West, Adaira struggles to adjust to the more brutal, bitter ways of life among the Breccans. Striving to find her place in the clan, she swiftly realizes that it just might be the last role she desires to hold. And while magic blooms effortlessly for the Breccans in the west, the spirits continue to suffer beneath Bane&#8217;s harsh power, felt in every gust of wind.In the East, Jack is adrift without Adaira until he sings to the ember-weak fire </p>

<p>Summary : From one of the most-viewed spoken word poets of all time, a collection exploring loneliness, anxiety, and longing&#8211;and finding peace, and even joy, in unexpected places   Sabrina Benaim, author of Depression &amp; Other Magic Tricks, has connected deeply with readers and reached millions of viewers through her poetry, breaking down the stigma around mental illness. Now, she dives into challenging and universal territory: grief over a relationship&#8217;s end, loneliness in a world under lockdown, and the anxiety of caring for a loved one from afar in the wake of a serious diagnosis.Unfurling over the course of one month in 2020, in seventy-five original poems, I Love You, Call Me Back grapples with mental health struggles and the uncertainty of the moment and beyond. In isolation, Sabrina dares to embrace loneliness in all its permutations: the sorrow of getting your mother&#8217;s voicemail when you call to say &#8220;I love you; the bitter-sweetness when your dog takes up your ex&#8217;s side of the bed; </p>

<p>Summary : If you&#8217;re a nurse, or want to become one, you already know how incredibly fulfilling the profession can be. With skill and compassion, nurses save lives. There&#8217;s nothing more gratifying than helping someone who trusts and depends on you to make it through a difficult time. Nursing can also be stressful &#8211; but that stress can be ameliorated by working in a great team, or exacerbated by passive-aggressiveness communication or hurt feelings. Keeping our patients safe and providing the most optimal outcomes depends entirely on our relationships with each other. Nurses who learn this material will be as confident in their communication skills as they are in their clinical skills per the AACN standards. The world needs nurse leaders who are bold, valiant, audacious and courageous. In &#8220;The Dauntless Nurse: Communication Confidence Builder&#8221; you&#8217;ll learn to pro-actively address and eliminate the trivial and unnecessary frustrations that distract and undermine your confidence. You&#8217;ll learn how </p>

<p>Summary : There is a wisdom awaiting you that is not supposed to be a secret. It is ancient, and it is available, but it is widely unknown. It has been hidden for too long, and it is time for it to be revealed.Existence is not meaningless. Humanity is not irredeemable. The future is not bleak. The alienation and despair that lurk just beneath the surface of the modern psyche are not the inevitable human condition. They are the result of misguided ideologies that pervade our global culture and invade our every thought. Each of us &#8211; each and every one of us &#8211; is so much more than we imagine. We are here for a reason, and we are equipped with all of the capabilities that we require.&#8221;You&#8221; is an introduction to the deepest depths of the human experience based on the esoteric teachings of the Torah.

<p>Summary : A fun, flirty teen debut from Wattpad phenom Alex Light about a fake relationship and real love. Perfect for Jenny Han fans.It?s been years since seventeen-year-old Becca Hart believed in true love. But when her former best friend teases her for not having had a boyfriend, Becca impulsively pretends she?s been secretly seeing someone.Brett Wells has it all. As captain of the football team and one of the most popular guys in his school, he should have no problem finding someone to date, but he?s always been more focused on his future than who to bring to prom.When he overhears Becca?s lie, Brett decides to step in and be the mystery guy. It?s the perfect solution: he gets people off his back for not having a meaningful relationship and she can keep up the ruse that she?s got a boyfriend.Acting like the perfect couple isn?t easy, though, especially when you barely know the other person. But with Becca still picking up the pieces from when her world was blown apart years ago and Brett </p>

The hilarious voice of Greg and Chris comes through throughout and the idea of an adventure within a dream, a hospital heist and Dream Bandits will really set this book apart from anything else in the market.</p>

<p>Summary : After months of refusing, I finally agreed to make the move to Alrick Falls. My family thought it was best &#8211; that a new scene would be good for me &#8211; and I was sick of having the same conversation. So here I am, and the plan is simple. Smile through each day and avoid her at all cost. It&#8217;s perfect. Until the cocky quarterback comes into play. The last thing I want is his crooked grin and dark brown eyes focused on me. Yet here he is, constantly in my space, pushing me, daring me to care. Telling me what I think and feel, as if he knows. He doesn?t know anything. And I plan to keep it that way.

<p>Summary : After months of refusing, I finally agreed to make the move to Alrick Falls. My family thought it was best &#8211; that a new scene would be good for me &#8211; and I was sick of having the same conversation. So here I am, and the plan is simple. Smile through each day and avoid her at all cost. It&#8217;s perfect. Until the cocky quarterback comes into play. The last thing I want is his crooked grin and dark brown eyes focused on me. Yet here he is, constantly in my space, pushing me, daring me to care. Telling me what I think and feel, as if he knows. He doesn?t know anything. And I plan to keep it that way.  He?s the persistent playboy who refuses to walk away. I?m the impassive new girl with nothing left to give. Things are about to get complicated.</p>

<p>Summary : Una gu?a indispensable sobre los sorprendentes alimentos que combaten: toc, trastornos del sue?o, tdah, demencia, depresi?n, ansiedad y m?s. Cuando se trata de la dieta, la mayor?a de las personas se preocupa por perder peso y estar en forma, pero lo que comemos afecta no s?lo lo que vemos. Estudios recientes han demostrado que la alimentaci?n tiene un efecto profundo en nuestro cerebro y en condiciones de salud mental tan variadas como el Trastorno por D?ficit de Atenci?n e Hiperactividad (tdah), la depresi?n, la ansiedad, los trastornos de sue?o, el Trastorno Obsesivo Compulsivo (toc), el Trastorno por Estr?s Postraum?tico (tpep), la demencia y m?s. Con base en estas investigaciones vanguardistas, la doctora Uma Naidoo &#8211;psiquiatra certificada, especialista en nutrici?n y chef profesional&#8211; nos explica las m?ltiples formas en que los alimentos contribuyen a nuestra salud mental y expone c?mo una buena dieta puede ayudar a tratar y prevenir diferentes problemas de salud psicol?gica </p>

Here, the internationally renowned production designer shares his expertise in an easy-to-follow and imaginative way ? giving tips, exercises, and a depth of knowledge garnered from a lifetime in the industry.Bacher&#8217;s production designs have established the look of many seminal animated films such as The Lion King, Balto, Mulan and Beauty and the Beast, so fans of his work will be delighted. While keeping the focus on storytelling, Bacher instructs readers in the art of animated cinematography with the ever-present aim of soliciting an emotional response from the audience. Vision: Color and Composition for Film represents an amazing depth of experience ? and is visually arresting to boot.</p>

<p>Summary : Practical Keys to Transforming the World around You In a world where evil dominates the headlines, we are often left wondering, &#8220;Will good really triumph over evil? Or are we hurtling toward oblivion?&#8221;It&#8217;s here, during this very hour&#8211;when political chaos seems to reign and the media persecutes anyone who disagrees with them&#8211;that God is searching for men and women who long for an infusion of boldness that possesses their souls, who will take a stand and be a voice for the Kingdom. His vision for the future is not bleak, and he is readying a heavy rain of transformation and revival. Here is the guidance and inspiration you need to become a vessel that catches the downpour of the Spirit&#8217;s rain&#8211;and helps release God&#8217;s Kingdom like a flood.</p>

<p>Summary : Practical Keys to Transforming the World around You In a world where evil dominates the headlines, we are often left wondering, &#8220;Will good really triumph over evil? Or are we hurtling toward oblivion?&#8221;It&#8217;s here, during this very hour&#8211;when political chaos seems to reign and the media persecutes anyone who disagrees with them&#8211;that God is searching for men and women who long for an infusion of boldness that possesses their souls, who will take a stand and be a voice for the Kingdom. His vision for the future is not bleak, and he is readying a heavy rain of transformation and revival. Here is the guidance and inspiration you need to become a vessel that catches the downpour of the Spirit&#8217;s rain&#8211;and helps release God&#8217;s Kingdom like a flood.</p>

<p>Summary : On the planet Tython, the ancient Je?daii order was founded. And at the feet of its wise Masters, Lanoree Brock learned the mysteries and methods of the Force?and found her calling as one of its most powerful disciples. But as strongly as the Force flowed within Lanoree and her parents, it remained absent in her brother, who grew to despise and shun the Je?daii, and whose training in its ancient ways ended in tragedy. Now, from her solitary life as a Ranger keeping order across the galaxy, Lanoree has been summoned by the Je?daii Council on a matter of utmost urgency. The leader of a fanatical cult, obsessed with traveling beyond the reaches of known space, is bent on opening a cosmic gateway using dreaded dark matter as the key?risking a cataclysmic reaction that will consume the entire star system. But more shocking to Lanoree than even the prospect of total galactic annihilation, is the decision of her Je?daii Masters to task her with the mission of preventing it. Until a </p>

And at the feet of its wise Masters, Lanoree Brock learned the mysteries and methods of the Force?and found her calling as one of its most powerful disciples. But as strongly as the Force flowed within Lanoree and her parents, it remained absent in her brother, who grew to despise and shun the Je?daii, and whose training in its ancient ways ended in tragedy. Now, from her solitary life as a Ranger keeping order across the galaxy, Lanoree has been summoned by the Je?daii Council on a matter of utmost urgency. The leader of a fanatical cult, obsessed with traveling beyond the reaches of known space, is bent on opening a cosmic gateway using dreaded dark matter as the key?risking a cataclysmic reaction that will consume the entire star system. But more shocking to Lanoree than even the prospect of total galactic annihilation, is the decision of her Je?daii Masters to task her with the mission of preventing it.

<p>Summary : This huge anthology offers a kaleidoscope of brilliant writing from the Magi of the imagination. Alberto Manguel has selected 72 fantastic tales from life on the edge of the twilight zone, with stories from Marguerite Yourcenar, Herman Hesse, Italo Calvino, Vladimir Nabokov, and many, many more. This is a collection of irresistible masterpieces, many of which have never before appeared in the English language.Fantastic literature Manguel writes in his introduction, makes use of our everyday world as a facade through which the undefinable appears, hinting at the half-forgotten dreams of our imagination. Unlike tales of fantasy, fantastic literature deals with what can be best defined as the impossible seeping into the possible, what Wallace Stevens calls black water breaking into reality. Fantastic literature never really explains everything, it thrives on surprise, on the unexpected logic that is born from its own rules.Contents:House taken over by Julio Cort?zarHow love came to </p>

<p>Summary : In a small town like ours, you?re either straight or you keep your mouth shut.Being gay would be dirty.Touching the guy who?s been your stepbrother since you were three would be dirty.Falling in love with him would be even worse.I protect him because it?s my job.I resist him because I have to.But when one night leads to two and two nights lead to more, lines are blurred and morals are tossed and my sanity takes a walk.Now we?re risking everything we have for something we know we shouldn?t want.And the only thing we?ll have left is each other.</p>

<p>Summary : I was kidnapped on my honeymoon by three masked men. Blindfolded. Bound. Destination unknown. I was told to stay silent and abide by their rules. But they didn&#8217;t realize I wasn&#8217;t a victim&#8230;not anymore. The open sea was my backdrop for nine torturous days. During that time, glimmers of my fate were revealed by a man with the mysterious chartreuse-colored eyes. He should have scared me, but he didn&#8217;t. He intrigued me. And I intrigued him. He punished me when I didn&#8217;t listen, which was every single day. But beneath his cruelty, I sensed he was guarding a grave secret. I was sold. And in a game of poker, no less. My buyer? A Russian mobster who likes to collect pretty things. Now that I know the truth, I only have one choice. Sink or swim. And when one fateful night presents me the opportunity, I take it. I just never anticipated my actions would leave me shipwrecked with my kidnapper. He needs me alive. I want him dead. But as days turn into weeks, one thing becomes clear&#8211;I should </p>

<p>Summary : I was kidnapped on my honeymoon by three masked men. Blindfolded. Bound. Destination unknown. I was told to stay silent and abide by their rules. But they didn&#8217;t realize I wasn&#8217;t a victim&#8230;not anymore. The open sea was my backdrop for nine torturous days. During that time, glimmers of my fate were revealed by a man with the mysterious chartreuse-colored eyes. He should have scared me, but he didn&#8217;t. He intrigued me. And I intrigued him. He punished me when I didn&#8217;t listen, which was every single day. But beneath his cruelty, I sensed he was guarding a grave secret. I was sold. And in a game of poker, no less. My buyer? A Russian mobster who likes to collect pretty things. Now that I know the truth, I only have one choice. Sink or swim. And when one fateful night presents me the opportunity, I take it. I just never anticipated my actions would leave me shipwrecked with my kidnapper. He needs me alive. I want him dead. But as days turn into weeks, one thing becomes clear&#8211;I should </p>

<p>Summary : A visual exploration of the power and behavior of light, across the electromagnetic spectrum, and how it affects life on earth and everything in the Universe.?Light allows us to see everything around us, but humans can only see a sliver of all light, known as the electromagnetic spectrum. Here, Kim Arcand and Megan Watzke present the subject of light as never before. Organized along the order of the electromagnetic spectrum, each chapter focuses on a different type of light. From radio waves, harnessed for telecommunications, to X-rays, which let us peer inside the human body and view areas around black holes in deep space, Arcand and Watzke show us all the important ways light impacts us. An introductory chapter describes what light is and how it behaves, while hundreds of full-color photographs and illustrations demonstrate concepts and make for a stunning book that&#8217;s a joy to read and browse.?</p>

The history of natural disasters is a history of ourselves.The Big Ones is a look at some of the most devastating disasters in human history, whose reverberations we continue to feel today.

<p>Summary : A novel about the forbidden union between two enslaved young men on a Deep South plantation, the refuge they find in each other, and a betrayal that threatens their existence.Isaiah was Samuel?s and Samuel was Isaiah?s. That was the way it was since the beginning, and the way it was to be until the end. In the barn they tended to the animals, but also to each other, transforming the hollowed-out shed into a place of human refuge, a source of intimacy and hope in a world ruled by vicious masters. But when an older man?a fellow slave?seeks to gain favor by preaching the master?s gospel on the plantation, the enslaved begin to turn on their own. Isaiah and Samuel?s love, which was once so simple, is seen as sinful and a clear danger to the plantation?s harmony.With a lyricism reminiscent of Toni Morrison, Robert Jones, Jr. fiercely summons the voices of slaver and the enslaved alike to tell the story of these two men; from Amos the preacher to the calculating slave-master himself to the </p>

<p>Summary : Here, two of the world?s leading couple therapists give readers an inside tour of what goes on inside the consulting rooms of their practice. They have been doing couples work for decades and still find it challenging. This book gathers together what they have learned over the years of their practice and touches on issues at the core of couples work. Topics addressed include:? You know that you need to ?treat the relationship,? but how are you supposed to get at something as elusive as ?a relationship??? Compared to an individual client, a relationship is an entirely different animal. What should you do first? What should you look for? What questions should you ask? If clients give different answers, who should you believe?? Which client is right if they argue in front of you? Which one is the culprit, and which one is innocent? Who should you empathize with?? How do you empathize with both clients if they have opposite points of view? Later on, if they end up separating does that </p>

<p>Summary : Gentle themes of resiliency, mindfulness, and self-care are brought home in this sweet and soulful picture book with charmingly graphic illustrations and a poetic text.I love listening to music, especially samba!It feels like my heart follows the beat.Meet a young girl who loves her cozy home. It smells like cinnamon tea and feels like warm pajamas. But even when she?s away from home, and everything is different, she finds a way to become her own home, where she feels calm. At night, when it?s too dark and her feet are cold, her room can be a little scary. But she creates her own light when she closes her eyes and thinks of the sun. With friendliness and charm, Juliana Perdomo, in her debut as author-illustrator, shows young readers how to find comfort and confidence within. Her heartwarming picture book reassures children that sometimes, everything we need?courage, joy, peace, and love?is already inside us.</p>

<p>Summary : One of the most remarkable memoirs ever written.One of the ten books ? novels, memoirs and one very unusual biography ? that make up our Matchbook Classics? series, a stunningly redesigned collection of some of the best loved titles on our backlist. In December 1995, Jean-Dominique Bauby, editor-in-chief of French Elle and the father of two young children, suffered a massive stroke and found himself paralysed and speechless. But his mind remained as active and alert as it had ever been.Using his only functioning muscle ? his left eyelid ? he was determined to tell his remarkable story, painstakingly spelling it out letter by letter.The Diving-Bell and the Butterfly records Bauby?s lonely existence but also the ability to invent a life for oneself in the most appalling of circumstances. It one of the most extraordinary books about the triumph of the human spirit ever written.</p>

<p>Summary : Being Principe of an ancient vampire dynasty comes with difficult choices. For Byron Debrek that means putting the good of her clan and innocent mortals over her own desires. When she falls for the first woman to set her blood on fire in centuries, Byron must harden her heart and walk away. For Amelia Honey, a suit designer at a Savile Row tailor, the six months spent with her first love were the most wonderful time of her life. Byron made her feel like a princess and awakened her darkest sexual desires. But then she disappeared, leaving her nothing but a first-class plane ticket and a broken heart.When a dangerous enemy befriends Amelia, Byron is compelled to act. Will she be able to regain Amelia?s trust and protect her? Or will pain and anger drive Amelia into the hands of Byron?s enemies, and into the middle of a vampire war?Cover Artist: Melody PondGenres: Paranormal &amp; Urban Fantasy / Romance</p>

<p>Summary : Two boys, alone in space.After the first settler on Titan trips her distress signal, neither remaining country on Earth can afford to scramble a rescue of its own, and so two sworn enemies are installed in the same spaceship.Ambrose wakes up on the Coordinated Endeavor, with no memory of a launch. There?s more that doesn?t add up: Evidence indicates strangers have been on board, the ship?s operating system is voiced by his mother, and his handsome, brooding shipmate has barricaded himself away. But nothing will stop Ambrose from making his mission succeed?not when he?s rescuing his own sister.In order to survive the ship?s secrets, Ambrose and Kodiak will need to work together and learn to trust one another? especially once they discover what they are truly up against. Love might be the only way to survive.</p>

I found a reliable theme, an approach to living that gave me more satisfaction, at the time, and still: If </p>

<p>Summary : I asked for help, instead I got engaged to the mafia boss.Rhea Cabrera has spent her life under the control of her father, desperate to escape his grasp and the arranged marriage he has planned for her. When she turns to the mafia boss for help, she doesn?t expect him to offer her a new arrangement.Gian DelGado has just taken over the Providence mafia and has no intentions of marrying anyone, but when a sassy woman shows up at his office, asking for his help, he gets hit with an idea.He offers her a deal: marry him instead.She?s not looking for a knight in shining armor, but she finds herself drawn to a man who represents everything she?s trying to leave behind.But it?s not a love filled marriage, it?s an arrangement, a trade from one monster to another.</p>

<p>Summary : The fascinating life story of Ignat Kaneff, one of Canada?s leading residential and commercial builders.When Ignat Kaneff arrived in Canada in 1951, he had a mere five dollars to his name, no proficiency in English, and very little education. Yet, this was the beginning of one of Canada?s great immigrant success stories. Having left his native Bulgaria at just fourteen, Kaneff?s journey to Canada was long. It even included a stint in wartime Germany, working as a market gardener, but his plans in Canada were much, much bigger.Kaneff began working in Toronto?s construction industry, where he showed tremendous drive, quickly founding a company and breaking ground on his first subdivision in 1956. He continued on a trajectory toward success, and by the 1970s was ranked among Canada?s top businessmen. Considered a pioneering citizen of the City of Mississauga, in 2017 he was inducted as a Member of the Order of Canada. Becoming a Somebody recounts his stunning rise to prominence.</p>

<p>Summary : Two short novels, including the title story and Black Fairy Tale, plus a bonus short story. Summer is a simple story of a nine-year-old girl who dies while on summer vacation. While her youthful killers try to hide her body, she tells us the story&#8211;from the point of view of her dead body&#8211;of the childrens&#8217; attempt to get away with murder. Black Fairy Tale is classic J-horror: a young girl loses an eye in an accident, but receives a transplant. Now she can see again, astonishingly what she sees out of her new left eye is the experiences and memories of its previous owner. Its previous deceased owner.</p>

<p>Summary : Written to commemorate the Bicentennial in 1976, James A. Michener?s magnificent saga of the West is an enthralling celebration of the frontier. Brimming with the glory of America?s past, the story of Colorado?the Centennial State?is manifested through its people: Lame Beaver, the Arapaho chieftain and warrior, and his Comanche and Pawnee enemies; Levi Zendt, fleeing with his child bride from the Amish country; the cowboy, Jim Lloyd, who falls in love with a wealthy and cultured Englishwoman, Charlotte Seccombe. In Centennial, trappers, traders, homesteaders, gold seekers, ranchers, and hunters are brought together in the dramatic conflicts that shape the destiny of the legendary West?and the entire country. ?Praise for Centennial ? ?A hell of a book . . . While he fascinates and engrosses, Michener also educates.??Los Angeles Times ? ?An engrossing book . . . imaginative and intricate . . . teeming with people and giving a marvelous sense of the land.??The Plain Dealer ? ?Michener </p>

<p>Summary : Do not touch the sword.Do not turn the key.Do not open the gate.In the land of the unforgiving desert, there isn?t much a girl wouldn?t do for a glass of water.Twenty-four-year-old Saeris Fane is good at keeping secrets. No one knows about the strange powers she possesses, or the fact that she has been picking pockets and stealing from the Undying Queen?s reservoirs for as long as she can remember.But a secret is like a knot.Sooner or later, it is bound to come undone.When Saeris comes face-to-face with Death himself, she inadvertently reopens a gateway between realms and is transported to a land of ice and snow. The Fae have always been the stuff of myth, of legend, of nightmares?but it turns out they?re real, and Saeris has landed herself right in the middle of a centuries-long conflict that might just get her killed.The first of her kind to tread the frozen mountains of Yvelia in over a thousand years, Saeris mistakenly binds herself to Kingfisher, a handsome Fae warrior, who has </p>

<p>Summary : The one thing you never talk about while you?re in the Scholomance is what you?ll do when you get out. Not even the richest enclaver would tempt fate that way. But it?s all we dream about: the hideously slim chance we?ll survive to make it out the gates and improbably find ourselves with a life ahead of us, a life outside the Scholomance halls.And now the impossible dream has come true. I?m out, we?re all out?and I didn?t even have to turn into a monstrous dark witch to make it happen. So much for my great-grandmother?s prophecy of doom and destruction. I didn?t kill enclavers, I saved them. Me and Orion and our allies. Our graduation plan worked to perfection: We saved everyone and made the world safe for all wizards and brought peace and harmony to all the enclaves everywhere.Ha, only joking! Actually, it?s gone all wrong. Someone else has picked up the project of destroying enclaves in my stead, and probably everyone we saved is about to get killed in the brewing enclave war. And </p>

<p>Summary : The first title from the original webcomics imprint of DC Comics!South of the Mason-Dixon Line lies a strange land of gods and monsters; a world parallel to our own, born from centuries of slavery, civil war, and hate.Lee Wagstaff is the daughter of a black sharecropper in the depression-era town of Charon, Mississippi. When Lily Westmoreland, her white playmate, is snatched by agents of an evil creature known as Bog, Lee&#8217;s father is accused of kidnapping. Lee&#8217;s only hope is to follow Lily&#8217;s trail into this fantastic and frightening alternate world. Along the way she enlists the help of a benevolent, blues singing, swamp monster called Bayou. Together, Lee and Bayou trek across a hauntingly familiar Southern Neverland, confronting creatures both benign and malevolent, in an effort to rescue Lily and save Lee&#8217;s father from being lynched.BAYOU VOL. 1 collects the first four chapters of the critically acclaimed webcomic series by Glyph Award nominee Jeremy Love.</p>

<p>Summary : George Floyd&#8217;s murder in Minneapolis triggered abolitionist shockwaves. Calls to defund the police found receptive ears around the world. Shortly after, Sarah Everard&#8217;s murder by a serving police officer sparked a national abolitionist movement in Britain. But to abolish the police, prisons and borders, we must confront the legacy of Empire. Abolition Revolution is a guide to abolitionist politics in Britain, drawing out rich histories of resistance from rebellion in the colonies to grassroots responses to carceral systems today. The authors argue that abolition is key to reconceptualising revolution for our times &#8211; linking it with materialist feminisms, anti-capitalist class struggle, internationalist solidarity and anti-colonialism. Perfect for reading groups and activist meetings, this is an invaluable book for those new to abolitionist politics &#8211; whilst simultaneously telling a passionate and authoritative story about the need for abolition and revolution in Britain and globally.</p>

<p>Summary : Among the substantial legacy of martial arts texts left by combat masters working in the medieval German tradition, this book stands out as one of the most remarkable and important, translated for the first time in English by Jeffrey Forgeng. The only major original text in this corpus to be disseminated in print, Meyer&#8217;s manual is an ambitious comprehensive encyclopedia of traditional German martial arts, covering a range of weapons forms, and offering a rationalized introduction to a complex and organic tradition inherited from the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Summary : Among the substantial legacy of martial arts texts left by combat masters working in the medieval German tradition, this book stands out as one of the most remarkable and important, translated for the first time in English by Jeffrey Forgeng. The only major original text in this corpus to be disseminated in print, Meyer&#8217;s manual is an ambitious comprehensive encyclopedia of traditional German martial arts, covering a range of weapons forms, and offering a rationalized introduction to a complex and organic tradition inherited from the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Summary : &#8216;If we want to understand what has been lost to time, there is no way other than through the exercise of imagination &#8230; imagination applied with delicate rather than broad strokes&#8217;. So wrote the award winning Japanese author Kyoko Nakajima of her story, Things Remembered and Things Forgotten, a piece that illuminates, as if by throwing a switch, the layers of wartime devastation that lie just below the surface of Tokyo&#8217;s insistently modern culture.The ten acclaimed stories in this collection are pervaded by an air of Japanese ghostliness. In beautifully crafted and deceptively light prose, Nakajima portrays men and women beset by cultural amnesia and unaware of how haunted they are &#8211; by fragmented memories of war and occupation, by fading traditions, by buildings lost to firestorms and bulldozers, by the spirits of their recent past.</p>

<p>Summary : From the bestselling author of Ghosts and Everything I Know About Love: a story of heartbreak and friendship and how to survive both.Andy&#8217;s story wasn&#8217;t meant to turn out this way. Living out of a suitcase in his best friends&#8217; spare room, waiting for his career as a stand-up comedian to finally take off, he struggles to process the life-ruining end of his relationship with the only woman he&#8217;s ever truly loved.As he tries to solve the seemingly unsolvable mystery of his broken relationship, he contends with career catastrophe, social media paranoia, a rapidly dwindling friendship group and the growing suspicion that, at 35, he really should have figured this all out by now.Andy has a lot to learn, not least his ex-girlfriend&#8217;s side of the story.Warm, wise, funny and achingly relatable, Dolly Alderton&#8217;s highly-anticipated second novel is about the mystery of what draws us together &#8211; and what pulls us apart &#8211; the pain of really growing up, and the stories we tell about our lives.</p>
