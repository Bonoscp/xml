<p>Summary : The lies will come crumbling down? and the bodies will start piling up.Once upon a time, I saved Marcus Constantine?s life.Then he, Theo, and Ryland saved mine.But that?s not enough anymore. It?s not enough to just survive. I want a future with these men. I want peace and happiness.And the only way to find it is through war.We?re done playing defense. This time, the game won?t stop until the blood of our enemies runs as red as the roses on my tattoo. Because it?s a different game now, and we make the rules.More and more, I think Marcus was right. Our souls really are bound by blood.These men are a part of me.And God fucking help anyone who threatens them.This is the final book in the Ruthless Games series, a new adult reverse harem romance. It contains steamy bedroom scenes, violence, and dark subject matter. Please venture between these pages at your own discretion.</p>

<p>Summary : In 1976, Ben Martini was diagnosed with schizophrenia. A decade later, his brother Olivier was told he had the same disease. For the past thirty years the Martini family has struggled to comprehend and cope with a devastating illness, frustrated by a health care system lacking in resources and empathy, the imperfect science of medication, and the strain of mental illness on familial relationships. Throughout it all, Olivier, an accomplished visual artist, drew. His sketches, comic strips, and portraits document his experience with, and capture the essence of, this all too frequently misunderstood disease. In Bitter Medicine , Olivier&#8217;s poignant graphic narrative runs alongside and communicates with a written account of the past three decades by his younger brother, award-winning author and playwright Clem Martini. The result is a layered family memoir that faces head-on the stigma attached to mental illness. Shot through with wry humour and unapologetic in its politics, Bitter </p>

<p>Summary : Sei confessioni in un?unica voce, la cui gioia liberatoria affiora, in filigrana, dalla trama delle parole. Con questo libro che le ? valso il prestigioso Irish Book Award, Emilie Pine scosta il velo dallo specchio, si guarda, e si racconta con la forza di chi ha deciso di indagare se stessa infischiandosene dell?approvazione altrui. Dalle difficolt? relazionali con un padre amato e odiato, all?esperienza cruda dell?infertilit?, alla fame imposta al proprio corpo di adolescente, fino al corpo, ancora lui, violato dalla prepotenza degli uomini: in queste pagine non trovate sguardi accomodanti ma parole come frecce imbevute di onest? e fierezza.Scava con foga, Emilie, nei ricordi. E dagli angoli bui della clandestinit? emotiva ecco venire alla luce un autoritratto schietto e tagliente, una voce pronta a dettare le sue regole, figlie di una storia personale ma in cui ogni donna potr? riconoscere una caduta, o una vittoria, comunque la stessa, appassionata strada percorsa.</p>

Not only is her mother, Aviela, alive but she won?t stop until she tears down everything Liam and Melody have spent the past year building. With a new target on their back and the media now focused on their family as the Presidential election approaches, Liam and Melody must fight on two battlefronts. Melody is torn between being in love with Liam and wanting to kill him for lying to her. Being in love and showing love are two different things in her world. Liam wants to do anything to protect his family even if that means hurting the people he loves. Family is everything? but what happens when they?re out for your blood? Everything they have been through is nothing compared to what is coming&#8230; <br />

From small tech start-ups or large traditional companies, organizations need to be fast, flexible and digitally empowered to succeed. However, too many companies are stuck with siloed, compliance-driven HR processes that work in opposition to the business rather than supporting it.

It is a practical guide written specifically for people professionals on how the HR function can develop agile processes and practices that save time, boost performance and support overall business goals.Covering every aspect of the HR function from people processes, ways of working and HR services to organization design, operating models and HR teams, Agile HR is an essential guide for all HR practitioners wanting to make their HR practices agile and drive business performance but don&#8217;t know where to start. As well as guidance </p>

<p>Summary : This timely and compelling book conceptualizes Ethnic Studies not only as a vehicle to transform and revitalize the school curriculum but also as a way to reinvent teaching. Drawing on Sleeter&#8217;s research review on the impact of Ethnic Studies commissioned by the National Education Association (NEA), the authors show how the traditional curriculum&#8217;s Eurocentric view of the world affects diverse student populations. The text highlights several contemporary exemplars of curricula&#8211;from classroom level to district or state-wide&#8211;illustrating core concepts in Ethnic Studies across a variety of disciplines and grade levels. A final chapter considers how research on P-12 ethnic studies can be conceptualized and conducted in ways that further both advocacy and program sustainability. Transformative Ethnic Studies in Schools is essential reading for educators working to transform schools by rehumanizing learning spaces for all students.Book Features: Explores how the traditional curriculum is </p>

<p>Summary : When Green Mountain College in Poultney, Vermont, announced that two oxen called Bill and Lou would be killed and turned into hamburgers despite their years of service as unofficial college and town mascots, pattrice jones and her colleagues at nearby VINE Sanctuary offered an alternative scenario: to allow the elderly bovines to retire to the sanctuary. What transpired after this simple offer was a catastrophe of miscommunication, misdirection, and misinterpretations, as the college dug in its heels, activists piled on, and social media erupted.Part true-crime mystery, part on-the-ground reportage, and part sociocultural critique, The Oxen at the Intersection is a brilliant unearthing of the assumptions, preconceptions, and biases that led all concerned with the lives and deaths of these two animals to fail to achieve their ends. How and why the threads of this story unspooled, as jones reveals, raises profound questions?most particularly about how ideas rooted in history, race, </p>

Vorremmo avere le migliori universit? del pianeta e bellezze naturali adeguatamente valorizzate, prodotti culturali dall&#8217;influenza globale e la possibilit? di definire ?made in Italy? non solo un paio di scarpe ma anche un&#8217;app capace di costruire il futuro e un&#8217;idea che sappia cambiare il mondo. Vorremmo essere il posto ideale per chiunque voglia realizzare i propri sogni, per chiunque abbia un progetto e cerchi le condizioni ideali per trasformarlo in realt?, e magari anche avere una classe dirigente progressista, sensibile, accogliente. Insomma, vorremmo essere un po&#8217; pi? come la California, che infatti da secoli ? considerata la ?fine del mondo?: un paradiso di tolleranza, prosperit? e paesaggi spettacolari, la terra promessa, la pi? pura incarnazione del sogno </p>

<p>Summary : Quando noi italiani pensiamo alla nazione che vorremmo diventare, cosa ci viene in mente?Probabilmente vorremmo avere un&#8217;economia in grande crescita e la piena un paese in cui chiunque voglia lavorare possa farlo. Vorremmo avere le migliori universit? del pianeta e bellezze naturali adeguatamente valorizzate, prodotti culturali dall&#8217;influenza globale e la possibilit? di definire ?made in Italy? non solo un paio di scarpe ma anche un&#8217;app capace di costruire il futuro e un&#8217;idea che sappia cambiare il mondo. Vorremmo essere il posto ideale per chiunque voglia realizzare i propri sogni, per chiunque abbia un progetto e cerchi le condizioni ideali per trasformarlo in realt?, e magari anche avere una classe dirigente progressista, sensibile, accogliente. Insomma, vorremmo essere un po&#8217; pi? come la California, che infatti da secoli ? considerata la ?fine del mondo?: un paradiso di tolleranza, prosperit? e paesaggi spettacolari, la terra promessa, la pi? pura incarnazione del sogno </p>

<p>Summary : A veteran math educator reveals the hidden fascinations of geometry and why this staple of math education is important.If you remember anything about high school geometry class, it&#8217;s probably doing proofs. But geometry is more than axioms, postulates, theorems, and proofs. It&#8217;s the science of beautiful and extraordinary geometric relationships&#8211;most of which is lost in high school classrooms where the focus is on the rigor of logically proving those relationships. This book will awaken readers to the appeal of geometry by placing the focus squarely on geometry&#8217;s visually compelling features and intrinsic elegance. Who knew that straight lines, circles, and area could be so interesting? Not to mention optical illusions. So get out the rulers, compasses, or even a software program, and discover geometry for the first time.</p>

<p>Summary : You may never stop loving the one you lost. But you can still find love again.Kate is a bit of a mess. Two years after losing her young husband Cameron, she?s grieving, solo parenting, working like mad at her university fundraising job, always dropping the ball?and yet clinging to her sense of humor.Lurching from one comedic crisis to the next, she also navigates an overbearing mom and a Tinder-obsessed best friend who&#8217;s determined to matchmake Kate with her hot new neighbor.When an in-flight problem leaves Kate and her boss, Hugh, stranded for a weekend on the east coast of Australia, she finally has a chance, away from her son, to really process her grief and see what?s right in front of her. Can she let go of the love of her life and risk her heart a second time?When it becomes clear that Hugh is hiding a secret, Kate turns to the trail of scribbled notes she once used to hold her life together. The first note captured her heart. Will the last note set it free?The Last Love Note </p>

Arbon Academy was supposed to be a bright new start. An opportunity for greatness, and something an orphan girl could only dream of. For a while there, it seemed to be exactly that.?  But Violet&#8217;s bright future is suddenly looking dim. Arbon Academy and Prince Alex are nothing but a facade. A trap.  In a sinister world of ballgowns and backstabbing, of perfumes and politics, of indulgent parties and illegal sword fights, Violet now faces the biggest challenge of all. Recovering her shattered heart from the prince who crushed it.?  Supported by her new friends, Violet wants to make Alex feel the pain of his betrayal. Prince Rafe wants nothing more than to help make that happen, but things aren&#8217;t always so straightforward.?  Don&#8217;t break tradition. Don&#8217;t let them know you know.? Don&#8217;t lose your heart&#8230; again.  These rules will keep Violet alive. But at what </p>

<p>Summary : HypnoBirthing(R) has gained momentum around the globe as a positive and empowering method of childbirth. In fact, more than 25,000 books were sold last year through the author&#8217;s website alone, and according to Nielsen BookScan, over 70,000 were sold through reporting retailers since its publication in 2005.Here&#8217;s why: HypnoBirthing helps women to become empowered by developing an awareness of the instinctive birthing capability of their bodies. It greatly reduces the pain of labor and childbirth; frequently eliminates the need for drugs; reduces the need for caesarian surgery or other doctor-controlled birth interventions; and it also shortens birthing and recovery time, allowing for better and earlier bonding with the baby, which has been proven to be vital to the mother-child bond. What&#8217;s more, parents report that their infants sleep better and feed more easily when they haven&#8217;t experienced birth trauma.HypnoBirthing founder Marie Mongan knows from her own four births that it is </p>

<p>Summary : Saturn is the showpiece planet of our solar system. It may not be the largest, nor the smallest, nor even the only planet with rings. But it is among the most stunning objects in the sky and is always breathtaking when seen in a telescope. This is a beautifully illustrated, authoritative overview of the entire history of humankind?s fascination with the ringed planet, from the first low-resolution views by Galileo, Huygens, and other early observers with telescopes to the most recent discoveries by the spacecraft Cassini, which studied the planet at close range between 2004 and 2017. Saturn describes the planet from inside out, detailing the complicated system of rings and their interaction with Saturn?s bevy of satellites, and it considers how Saturn formed and the role it played in the early history of the solar system. Featuring the latest research and a spectacular array of images, this book will appeal to anyone who has ever gazed with wonder upon the sixth planet from the sun.</p>

<p>Summary : It is so good, after so many years of public indifference, even hostility towards Vincent and his work, to feel towards the end of my life that the battle is won.&#8217; JO VAN GOGH-BONGER TO GUSTAVE COQUIOT, 1922&#8217;It is a sacrifice for the sake of Vincent&#8217;s glory.&#8217; JO VAN GOGH-BONGER ON THE SALE OF &#8216;THE SUNFLOWERS&#8217; TO THE NATIONAL GALLERY, UK, 1924Little known but no less influential, Jo van Gogh-Bonger was sister-in-law of Vincent van Gogh, wife of his brother, Theo. When the brothers died soon after each other, she took charge of Van Gogh&#8217;s artistic legacy and devoted the rest of her life to disseminating his work.Despite being widowed with a young son, Jo successfully navigated the male-dominated world of the art market-publishing Van Gogh&#8217;s letters, organizing exhibitions in the Netherlands and throughout the world, and making strategic sales to private individuals and influential dealers-ultimately establishing Van Gogh&#8217;s reputation as one of the finest artists of his generation.

When the brothers died soon after each other, she took charge of Van Gogh&amp;#8217;s artistic legacy and devoted the rest of her life to disseminating his work.Despite being widowed with a young son, Jo successfully navigated the male-dominated world of the art market-publishing Van Gogh&amp;#8217;s letters, organizing exhibitions in the Netherlands and throughout the world, and making strategic sales to private individuals and influential dealers-ultimately establishing Van Gogh&amp;#8217;s reputation as one of the finest artists of his generation.

<p>Summary : Brother follows a teenager determined to break from his family?s unconventional?and deeply disturbing?traditions.Deep in the heart of Appalachia stands a crooked farmhouse miles from any road. The Morrows keep to themselves, and it?s served them well so far. When girls go missing off the side of the highway, the cops don?t knock on their door. Which is a good thing, seeing as to what?s buried in the Morrows? backyard. But nineteen-year-old Michael Morrow isn?t like the rest of his family. He doesn?t take pleasure in the screams that echo through the trees. Michael pines for normalcy, and he?s sure that someday he?ll see the world beyond West Virginia. When he meets Alice, a pretty girl working at a record shop in the small nearby town of Dahlia, he?s immediately smitten. For a moment, he nearly forgets about the monster he?s become. But his brother, Rebel, is all too eager to remind Michael of his place?</p>

<p>Summary : In this riveting, feminist tale perfect for fans of Katee Robert and Nalini Singh, two sisters battle for a single throne, warring factions take up arms, a land is divided, and uncertain allies become very certain lovers. With subtle commentary on today?s political polarization, this riveting epic celebrates strong female characters and champions the underdog with diverse, expert world building. Gods save the queen!Ainsley Farmerson has always planned to break free of the family business?and the family drama. But what was once farming, smithworking, and bickering over the dinner table has turned into open warfare between sisters. Sides have been taken, lives are on the line, and Ainsley has no doubt which sister must be queen. She?ll do whatever is necessary to take down the soulless Beatrix. Even if that means joining forces with angry battle nuns, irritating monks, and overbearing centaurs. Gruffyn of the Torn Moon Clan has no time for human beings. And yet . . . there is something </p>

<p>Summary : It is the late twenty-first century, and Momo is the most celebrated dermal care technician in all of T City. Humanity has migrated to domes at the bottom of the sea to escape devastating climate change. The world is dominated by powerful media conglomerates and runs on exploited cyborg labor. Momo prefers to keep to herself, and anyway she&#8217;s too busy for other relationships: her clients include some of the city&#8217;s best-known media personalities. But after meeting her estranged mother, she begins to explore her true identity, a journey that leads to questioning the bounds of gender, memory, self, and reality.First published in Taiwan in 1995, The Membranes is a classic of queer speculative fiction in Chinese. Chi Ta-wei weaves dystopian tropes&#8211;heirloom animals, radiation-proof combat drones, sinister surveillance technologies&#8211;into a sensitive portrait of one young woman&#8217;s quest for self-understanding.

<p>Summary : Attachment theory has entered the mainstream, but most discussions focus on how we can cultivate secure monogamous relationships. What if, like many people, you&#8217;re striving for secure, happy attachments with more than one partner?Polyamorous psychotherapist Jessica Fern breaks new ground by extending attachment theory into the realm of consensual nonmonogamy. Using her nested model of attachment and trauma, she expands our understanding of how these emotional experiences influence our relationships. Then, she sets out six specific strategies to help you move toward secure attachments in your multiple relationships.Polysecure is both a trailblaizing theoretical treatise and a practical guide. It provides nonmonogamous people with a new set of tools to navigate the complexities of multiple loving relationships, and offers radical new concepts that are sure to influence the conversation about attachment theory.</p>

<p>Summary : The monolithic architecture works well for small, simple applications. However, successful applications have a habit of growing. Eventually the development team ends up in what is known as monolithic hell. All aspects of software development and deployment become painfully slow. The solution is to adopt the microservice architecture, which structures an application as a services, organized around business capabilities. This architecture accelerates software development and enables continuous delivery and deployment of complex software applications.Microservice Patterns teaches enterprise developers and architects how to build applications with the microservice architecture. Rather than simply advocating for the use the microservice architecture, this clearly-written guide takes a balanced, pragmatic approach.

<p>Summary : Medical nihilism is the view that we should have little confidence in the effectiveness of medical interventions. This volume argues that medical nihilism is a compelling view of modern medicine. If we consider the frequency of failed medical interventions, the extent of misleading evidence in medical research, the thin theoretical basis of many interventions, and the malleability of empirical methods in medicine, and if we employ our best inductive framework, then our confidence in the effectiveness of medical interventions ought to be low. Part I articulates theoretical and conceptual groundwork, in which Jacob Stegenga offers a defence of a hybrid theory of disease, which forms the basis of a novel account of effectiveness, and applies this to pharmacological science and to issues such as medicalization. Part II critically examines details of medical research. Even the very best methods in medical research, such as randomized trials and meta-analyses, are malleable and suffer from </p>

<p>Summary : War according to SteinbeckJohn Steinbeck&#8217;s dispatches from World War II, filed for the New York Herald Tribune in 1943, vividly capture the human side of war. Writing from England in the midst of the London blitz, North Africa, and Italy, Steinbeck focuses on the people as opposed to the battles, portraying everyone from the guys in a bomber crew to Bob Hope on his USO tour. He eats and drink with soldiers behind enemy lines, talks with them, and fights beside them.First published in book form in 1958, these writings create an unforgettable portrait of life in wartime that continues to resonate with truth and humanity.</p>

<p>Summary : With courage, grace, and powerful insight, bestselling author Kristin Hannah captures the epic panorama of World War II and illuminates an intimate part of history seldom seen: the women&#8217;s war. The Nightingale tells the stories of two sisters, separated by years and experience, by ideals, passion and circumstance, each embarking on her own dangerous path toward survival, love, and freedom in German-occupied, war-torn France?a heartbreakingly beautiful novel that celebrates the resilience of the human spirit and the durability of women. It is a novel for everyone, a novel for a lifetime.</p>

<p>Summary : This is the sequel to the New York Times best-selling Wool series. It combines the three Shift books into a single audiobook in order to save the listener a few bucks. The saga concludes with Dust, which will be available in late 2013.In 2007, the Center for Automation in Nanobiotech (CAN) outlined the hardware and software platform that would one day allow robots smaller than human cells to make medical diagnoses, conduct repairs, and even self-propagate.In the same year, the CBS network re-aired a program about the effects of propranolol on sufferers of extreme trauma.

<p>Summary : The infamous Professor James Moriarty is a brooding presence in all of the adventures of celebrated British detective Sherlock Holmes. Yet his actions are described only once in The Final Problem, when he and Holmes wrestle on the brink of the Reichenbach Falls, and he gets scant mention in five other reports. So who exactly was Moriarty? A power-crazed mathematician, as described by Arthur Conan Doyle? The public face of an underground brotherhood? Or the cocaine-induced Hyde to Holmes&#8217;s Jekyll? The Moriarty Papers hold the key.Assembled after Moriarty&#8217;s death by his head of Security Operations, Colonel Sebastian Moran, these unique documents confirm Moriarty as the supervillain that Holmes took him for. Indeed, they reveal him to be a criminal mastermind.</p>

So who exactly was Moriarty? A power-crazed mathematician, as described by Arthur Conan Doyle? The public face of an underground brotherhood? Or the cocaine-induced Hyde to Holmes&#8217;s Jekyll? The Moriarty Papers hold the key.Assembled after Moriarty&#8217;s death by his head of Security Operations, Colonel Sebastian Moran, these unique documents confirm Moriarty as the supervillain that Holmes took him for. Indeed, they reveal him to be a criminal mastermind.</p>

<p>Summary : AN INSPIRING AND EMPOWERING MEMOIR ABOUT OVERCOMING CHALLENGES AND DISCOVERING TRUE HAPPINESS.  In The Gift of Stuttering, we meet Moe Mernick as he describes his journey facing the challenges presented to him in life. Moe grew up with a debilitating stutter and seemingly unanswerable questions about G-d; he found everyday life to be a painful and lonely experience. After years of suffering, though, he discovered an exceptional life of meaning and purpose and in doing so, turned the tables on his speech impediment.  The Gift of Stuttering is a remarkable story of one man&#8217;s journey from despair to hope, from anger at G-d to spiritual fulfillment, from being a rebellious teenager to becoming a motivational speaker and entrepreneur. It&#8217;s a story of finding meaning within life&#8217;s challenges and of transforming the heaviest burdens into the greatest gifts.</p>

<p>Summary : AN INSPIRING AND EMPOWERING MEMOIR ABOUT OVERCOMING CHALLENGES AND DISCOVERING TRUE HAPPINESS.  In The Gift of Stuttering, we meet Moe Mernick as he describes his journey facing the challenges presented to him in life. Moe grew up with a debilitating stutter and seemingly unanswerable questions about G-d; he found everyday life to be a painful and lonely experience. After years of suffering, though, he discovered an exceptional life of meaning and purpose and in doing so, turned the tables on his speech impediment.  The Gift of Stuttering is a remarkable story of one man&#8217;s journey from despair to hope, from anger at G-d to spiritual fulfillment, from being a rebellious teenager to becoming a motivational speaker and entrepreneur. It&#8217;s a story of finding meaning within life&#8217;s challenges and of transforming the heaviest burdens into the greatest gifts.</p>

<p>Summary : The emergence of contemporary art, engaging widely with other disciplines, as a platform for exploring animal nature.Animals have become the focus of much recent art, informing numerous works and projects featured at major exhibitions including dOCUMENTA (13) (2013), the 10th Shanghai Biennale (2014), and the 56th Venice Biennale (2015). Contemporary art has emerged as a privileged terrain for exploring interspecies relationships, providing the conditions for diverse disciplines and theoretical positions to engage with animal behavior and consciousness.This interest in animal nature reflects a number of current issues. Observations of empathy among nonhumans prompt reconsiderations of the human. The nonverbal communication of animals has been compared with poetic expansion of the boundaries of language. And the freedom of animal life in the wild from capitalist subordination is seen as a potential model for reconfiguring society and our relationship to the wider environment. Artists&#8217; </p>

<p>Summary : Michael was in a hurry. He was scrambling up the ladder at Drake &amp; Sweeney, a giant D.C. law firm with eight hundred lawyers. The money was good and getting better; a partnership was three years away. He was a rising star with no time to waste, no time to stop, no time to toss a few coins into the cups of panhandlers. No time for a conscience.But a violent encounter with a homeless man stopped him cold. Michael survived; his assailant did not. Who was this man? Michael did some digging, and learned that he was a mentally ill veteran who&#8217;d been in and out of shelters for many years. Then Michael dug a little deeper, and found a dirty secret, and the secret involved Drake &amp; Sweeney. The fast track derailed; the ladder collapsed. Michael bolted from the firm and took a top-secret file with him. He landed in the streets, an advocate for the homeless, a street lawyer. And a thief.</p>

<p>Summary : Michael was in a hurry. He was scrambling up the ladder at Drake &amp; Sweeney, a giant D.C. law firm with eight hundred lawyers. The money was good and getting better; a partnership was three years away. He was a rising star with no time to waste, no time to stop, no time to toss a few coins into the cups of panhandlers. No time for a conscience.But a violent encounter with a homeless man stopped him cold. Michael survived; his assailant did not. Who was this man? Michael did some digging, and learned that he was a mentally ill veteran who&#8217;d been in and out of shelters for many years. Then Michael dug a little deeper, and found a dirty secret, and the secret involved Drake &amp; Sweeney. The fast track derailed; the ladder collapsed. Michael bolted from the firm and took a top-secret file with him. He landed in the streets, an advocate for the homeless, a street lawyer. And a thief.</p>

<p>Summary : When Thomas Gossett&#8217;s Race: The History of an Idea in America appeared in 1963, it explored the impact of race theory on American letters in a way that anticipated the investigation of race and culture being conducted today. Bold, rigorous, and broad in scope, Gossett&#8217;s book quickly established itself as a critical resource to younger scholars seeking a candid, theoretically sophisticated treatment of race in American cultural history.Here, reprinted without change, is Gossett&#8217;s classic study, making available to a new generation of scholars a lucid, accessibly written volume that ranges from colonial race theory and its European antecedents, through eighteenth- and nineteenth- century race pseudoscience, to the racialist dimension of American thought and literature emerging against backgrounds such as Anglo- Saxonism, westward expansion, Social Darwinism, xenophobia, World War I, and modern racial theory.Featuring a new afterword by the author, an introduction by series editors </p>

<p>Summary : The collection of ten absorbing tales by master psychotherapist Irvin D. Yalom uncovers the mysteries, frustrations, pathos, and humor at the heart of the therapeutic encounter. In recounting his patients? dilemmas, Yalom not only gives us a rare and enthralling glimpse into their personal desires and motivations but also tells us his own story as he struggles to reconcile his all-too human responses with his sensibility as a psychiatrist. Not since Freud has an author done so much to clarify what goes on between a psychotherapist and a patient.</p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;Ido in Autismland&#8221; opens a window into non-verbal autism through dozens of short, autobiographical essays each offering new insights into autism symptoms, effective and ineffective treatments and the inner emotional life of a severely autistic boy. In his pithy essays, author Ido Kedar, a brilliant sixteen year old with autism, challenges what he believes are misconceptions in many theories that dominate autism treatment today while he simultaneously chronicles his personal growth in his struggles to overcome his limitations.Ido spent the first half of his life locked internally, in silence, trapped in a remedial educational system that presumed he lacked the most basic comprehension, and unable to show the world that he understood everything. But at the age of seven, Ido was finally able to show that he had an intact mind and could understand. This led to the quest to find a system of communication that he could use despite his impaired motor control. Through the use of a letter </p>

<p>Summary : The most up-to-date and authoritative resource on the biology and evolution of solitary beesWhile social bees such as honey bees and bumble bees are familiar to most people, they comprise less than 10 percent of all bee species in the world. The vast majority of bees lead solitary lives, surviving without the help of a hive and using their own resources to fend off danger and protect their offspring. This book draws on new research to provide a comprehensive and authoritative overview of solitary bee biology, offering an unparalleled look at these remarkable insects.The Solitary Bees uses a modern phylogenetic framework to shed new light on the life histories and evolution of solitary bees. It explains the foraging behavior of solitary bees, their development, and competitive mating tactics. The book describes how they construct complex nests using an amazing variety of substrates and materials, and how solitary bees have co-opted beneficial mites, nematodes, and fungi to provide </p>

<p>Summary : What is more important? Friendship, loyalty, or love?Ridge and Sydney are thrilled to finally be together guilt-free. But as the two of them navigate this freedom, Warren and Bridgette?s relationship is as tumultuous as ever, and Maggie grapples with her illness.When she comes across an old list of things she wanted to do ?maybe one of these days,? Maggie decides to live life to the fullest and accomplish these dreams. Maggie keeps Ridge updated on her adventures, but he can?t help but worry, even as Sydney grows more and more suspicious about their friendship. But if she?s going to move past this jealousy, she?ll need to reconcile how she and Ridge came together with the fact that Maggie will always be in their lives somehow?or end up walking away from the man she loves so much.Featuring new songs by Griffin Peterson, this emotive and satisfying finale proves that maybe someday might be right now.</p>

<p>Summary : What is more important? Friendship, loyalty, or love?Ridge and Sydney are thrilled to finally be together guilt-free. But as the two of them navigate this freedom, Warren and Bridgette?s relationship is as tumultuous as ever, and Maggie grapples with her illness.When she comes across an old list of things she wanted to do ?maybe one of these days,? Maggie decides to live life to the fullest and accomplish these dreams. Maggie keeps Ridge updated on her adventures, but he can?t help but worry, even as Sydney grows more and more suspicious about their friendship. But if she?s going to move past this jealousy, she?ll need to reconcile how she and Ridge came together with the fact that Maggie will always be in their lives somehow?or end up walking away from the man she loves so much.Featuring new songs by Griffin Peterson, this emotive and satisfying finale proves that maybe someday might be right now.</p>

<p>Summary : Written in exile from Germany, this potent study of Richard Wagner explodes the frontiers of musical and cultural analysis. Wagner&#8217;s works are among the most controversial in the history of European music because of their powerful aesthetic qualities and, in wider political terms, because of their eventual assimilation into the official culture of the Third Reich. Measuring key elements of Wagner?s oeuvre with patent musical dexterity, Adorno sheds light on a nineteenth-century bourgeois figure whose operas betray the social gestures and high-culture fantasies that helped plant the seeds of the modern Culture Industry. Adorno provides deft musicological analyses of Wagner&#8217;s scores, compositional techniques, orchestration, and staging methods while quoting copiously from the musical dramas themselves. At the same time, he offers incisive reflections on Wagner&#8217;s social character and the ideological impulses of his artistic activity. A foreword by Slavoj Zizek situates Adorno?s </p>

<p>Summary : Five thousand years ago, there came to earth a magical being called Krishna, who brought about innumerable miracles for the good of mankind. Humanity despaired of its fate if the Blue God were to die but was reassured that he would return in a fresh avatar when needed in the eventual Dark Age?the Kaliyug.In modern times, a poor little rich boy grows up believing that he is that final avatar.Only, he is a serial killer.In this heart-stopping tale, the arrival of a murderer who executes his gruesome and brilliantly thought-out schemes in the name of God is the first clue to a sinister conspiracy to expose an ancient secret?Krishna?s priceless legacy to mankind.Historian Ravi Mohan Saini must breathlessly dash from the submerged remains of Dwarka and the mysterious lingam of Somnath to the icy heights of Mount Kailash, in a quest to discover the cryptic location of Krishna?s most prized possession. From the sand-washed ruins of Kalibangan to a Vrindavan temple destroyed by Aurangzeb, </p>

<p>Summary : Return to the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants . . . ten years later&#8221; &#8220;From #1 &#8220;New York Times&#8221; bestselling author Ann Brashares comes the welcome return of the characters whose friendship became a touchstone for a generation. Now Tibby, Lena, Carmen, and Bridget have grown up, starting their lives on their own. And though the jeans they shared are long gone, the sisterhood is everlasting.

Lena finds solace in her art, teaching in Rhode Island, but still thinks of Kostos and the road she didn&#8217;t take. Bridget lives with her longtime boyfriend, Eric, in San Francisco, and though a part of her wants to settle down, a bigger part can&#8217;t seem to shed her old restlessness.

<p>Summary : Portraiture tends to rely on standardized, established lighting techniques, but most photographers know that subscribing to traditional methods does not always flatter every subject. The techniques collected in this guide will heighten the senses of mystery and drama in a digital photographer&#8217;s work by enhancing shape and contrast, keeping images fashionable and appealing with less reliance on natural light, and illuminating a subject&#8217;s eyes without producing catchlights. In this manner, textbook lighting setups can act as a springboard to creating personal and artistic high-quality portraits featuring new, radically-altered lighting effects. Multiple series of before-and-after photos comprehensively illustrate how to utilize these new methods to create emotion-evoking works of art that do more than simply capture the likeness of a subject</p>

<p>Summary : In this first general theory for the analysis of popular literary formulas, John G. Cawelti reveals the artistry that underlies the best in formulaic literature. Cawelti discusses such seemingly diverse works as Mario Puzo&#8217;s The Godfather, Dorothy Sayers&#8217;s The Nine Tailors, and Owen Wister&#8217;s The Virginian in the light of his hypotheses about the cultural function of formula literature. He describes the most important artistic characteristics of popular formula stories and the differences between this literature and that commonly labeled &#8220;high&#8221; or &#8220;serious&#8221; literature. He also defines the archetypal patterns of adventure, mystery, romance, melodrama, and fantasy, and offers a tentative account of their basis in human psychology.</p>

<p>Summary : Acht mensen komen op een zondag in een schoolgebouw samen voor de opnamen van een wetenschapsprogramma. Maar die worden nooit gemaakt. Want plotseling klinkt er een knal. Op bevel van de autoriteiten gaan ramen, deuren en gordijnen dicht. En ze blijven dicht. Eerst dagen, dan weken. Door de ogen van tv-redactrice Merel zien we hoe de groep probeert zich staande te houden in een nieuwe wereld. Een wereld van duisternis en isolatie. Van slapen op een gymmat en tien korrels rijst per dag. Naarmate de voedselvoorraden verder slinken, lopen de spanningen tussen de schoolbewoners steeds hoger op. Als alles wat er was er niet meer is, wat is dan nog de waarde van liefde, loyaliteit en vriendschap?</p>

Maar die worden nooit gemaakt. Want plotseling klinkt er een knal. Op bevel van de autoriteiten gaan ramen, deuren en gordijnen dicht. En ze blijven dicht. Eerst dagen, dan weken. Door de ogen van tv-redactrice Merel zien we hoe de groep probeert zich staande te houden in een nieuwe wereld. Een wereld van duisternis en isolatie. Van slapen op een gymmat en tien korrels rijst per dag. Naarmate de voedselvoorraden verder slinken, lopen de spanningen tussen de schoolbewoners steeds hoger op. Als alles wat er was er niet meer is, wat is dan nog de waarde van liefde, loyaliteit en vriendschap?

<p>Summary : Durante casi 50 a?os la historia de Roma estuvo directamente asociada con el fascismo y con la utilizaci?n que ese movimiento hizo de ella. La simbolog?a y la leyenda de la antigua Roma fueron desvirtualizadas y utilizadas de un modo torticero en los fastos mussolinianos. Por ello no debe extra?arnos que cuando en 1957, pasada la segunda guerra mundial y con la nueva rep?blica ita?liana consolidada, apareci? Historia de Roma, de Indro Montanelli, se detonan inmediatamente la pol?mica y la fascinaci?n.Montanelli recuperaba la esencia hist?rica de una de las civilizaciones m?s influyentes de occidente a partir de la sencillez y la cordialidad. Esta obra describe las costumbres del pueblo, la vida cotidiana, a trav?s del humor y la divulgaci?n. El lector no encontrar? en este libro ninguna revelaci?n deslumbrante, ninguna referencia para especialistas; se acercar? a Roma de un modo llano y veraz.</p>

<p>Summary : From the beautiful apsaras of Hindu myth to the swan maidens of European fairy tales, tales of flying women&#8211;some carried by wings, others by rainbows, floating scarves, or flying horses&#8211;reveal both fascination with and ambivalence about female power and sexuality. In Women Who Fly, Serinity Young examines the motif of the flying woman as it appears in a wide variety of cultures and historical periods, expressed in legends, myths, rituals, sacred narratives, and artistic productions. She introduces a wide range of such figures, including supernatural women like the Valkyries of Norse legend, who transport men to immortality; winged deities like the Greek goddesses Iris and Nike; figures of terror like the Furies, witches, and succubi, airborne Christian mystics, and wayward women like Lilith and Morgan le Fay. Looking beyond the supernatural, Young examines the extraordinary mythology surrounding twentieth-century female aviators like Amelia Earhart and Hanna Reitsch.Throughout, the </p>

Looking beyond the supernatural, Young examines the extraordinary mythology surrounding twentieth-century female aviators like Amelia Earhart and Hanna Reitsch.Throughout, the Discover the Bestseller Everyone is Talking About: Read Women Who Fly: Goddesses, Witches, Mystics, and other Airborne Females PDF , Reading Women Who Fly: Goddesses, Witches, Mystics, and other Airborne Females pdf , Women Who Fly: Goddesses, Witches, Mystics, and other Airborne Females Handbook , Women Who Fly: Goddesses, Witches, Mystics, and other Airborne Females read , Women Who Fly: Goddesses, Witches, Mystics, and other Airborne Females epub , Women Who Fly: Goddesses, Witches, Mystics, and other Airborne Females in English , Women Who Fly: Goddesses, Witches, Mystics, and other Airborne Females Kindle , Women Who Fly: Goddesses, Witches, Mystics, and other Airborne Females audiobook Women Who Fly: Goddesses, Witches, Mystics, and other Airborne Females Summary.

<p>Summary : Questa ? la storia di un colpo di fulmine, di un lungo corteggiamento, di una passione profonda: quella di una scrittrice per una lingua straniera. Jhumpa Lahiri ? una giovane neolaureata quando visita per la prima volta Firenze; appena sente parlare l?italiano capisce che le ? stranamente familiare, che le ? necessario e deve apprenderlo. Non sa spiegarsi il perch? di un simile, repentino bisogno, ma sa che far? di tutto per soddisfarlo. Dapprima prova a studiare l?italiano nella sua citt?, New York, con una serie di insegnanti private, ma non basta. Anche le brevi visite successive, a Mantova, Milano, Venezia, non la appagano: vuole immergersi completamente nella realt? della nuova lingua. Si trasferisce a Roma, con tutta la famiglia. E l? comincia la vera avventura, fatta di slanci, entusiasmo e insieme di difficolt? ed estraniamento.

<p>Summary : ?Ci sono frontiere, dove stiamo imparando, e brucia il nostro desiderio di sapere. Sono nelle profondit? pi? minute del tessuto dello spazio, nelle origini del cosmo, nella natura del tempo, nel fato dei buchi neri, e nel funzionamento del nostro stesso pensiero. Qui, sul bordo di quello che sappiamo, a contatto con l&#8217;oceano di quanto non sappiamo, brillano il mistero del mondo, la bellezza del mondo, e ci lasciano senza fiato?. Tale ? il presupposto di queste ?brevi lezioni?, che ci guidano, con ammirevole trasparenza, attraverso alcune tappe inevitabili della rivoluzione che ha scosso la fisica nel secolo XX e la scuote tuttora: a partire dalla teoria della relativit? generale di Einstein e della meccanica quantistica fino alle questioni aperte sulla architettura del cosmo, sulle particelle elementari, sulla gravit? quantistica, sulla natura del tempo e della mente.</p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  &#8220;She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me.&#8221; <br />
So begins the timeless romance of Fitzwilliam Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice. Jane Austen&#8217;s classic novel is beloved by millions, but little is revealed in the book about the mysterious and handsome hero, Mr. Darcy. And so the question has long remained: Who is Fitzwilliam Darcy? In An Assembly Such as This, Pamela Aidan finally answers that long-standing question. In this first book of her Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman trilogy, she reintroduces us to Darcy during his visit to Hertfordshire with his friend Charles Bingley and reveals Darcy&#8217;s hidden perspective on the events of Pride and Prejudice. As Darcy spends more time at Netherfield supervising Bingley and fending off Miss Bingley&#8217;s persistent advances, his unwilling attraction to Elizabeth grows?as does his concern about her relationship with his nemesis, George Wickham.Setting the story vividly against the colorful historical and political background </p>

<p>Summary : He&#8217;s on a top-secret assignment.All of London knows Beau Bellham as the Marquess of Bellingham, but only a trusted few know he also works for the Home Office. His specialty? Scouting out traitors to the Crown. So, when one of his friends pretends to be a footman at a house party in order to find a wife, Beau decides posing as a valet at the same gathering will be the perfect cover for him to spy on the men he suspects of treason. What Beau doesn&#8217;t count on, however, is butting heads with a far-too-certain-of-herself maid who gives him hell at every turn.She&#8217;s about to blow his cover.Miss Marianne Notley is a lady&#8217;s maid with more secrets than hairpins. When she meets her employer&#8217;s new valet, she distrusts him immediately. Never mind his dashing good looks and irrepressible charm, he&#8217;s a bit too sure of himself and asks a few too many questions for her liking. She&#8217;s on a mission to reveal the mysterious valet&#8217;s true identity, and she&#8217;s not above wielding her own considerable charms </p>

<p>Summary : In 1978, a young killer whale Keiko was collected off the east coast of Iceland and spent the next 18 years in human care. At Reino Aventura Park in Mexico, his home was not conducive to good health, and over time his condition deteriorated. In 1993, Keiko became the star of &#8220;Free Willy,&#8221; a Warner Bros. blockbuster movie, that enchanted the public and led children and adults to believe that a whale, long-held in the care of man, could successfully make its way in the wild.Animal rights organizations lobbied for a real-life release program for Keiko, similar to his fictitious counterpart, and millions of dollars were raised to return the orca back to his home waters.Author Mark Simmons was leader of the team of animal behaviorists brought to Iceland as part of the release project. But the program was doomed to failure from the start; plagued by hidden agendas and an organization unable to recognize that Keiko needed to learn to &#8220;be&#8221; wild before any chance at survival could exist.&#8221;</p>

At Reino Aventura Park in Mexico, his home was not conducive to good health, and over time his condition deteriorated. In 1993, Keiko became the star of &amp;#8220;Free Willy,&amp;#8221; a Warner Bros. blockbuster movie, that enchanted the public and led children and adults to believe that a whale, long-held in the care of man, could successfully make its way in the wild.Animal rights organizations lobbied for a real-life release program for Keiko, similar to his fictitious counterpart, and millions of dollars were raised to return the orca back to his home waters.Author Mark Simmons was leader of the team of animal behaviorists brought to Iceland as part of the release project. But the program was doomed to failure from the start; plagued by hidden agendas and an organization unable to recognize that Keiko needed to learn to &amp;#8220;be&amp;#8221; wild before any chance at survival could exist.&amp;#8221; Discover the Bestseller Everyone is Talking About: Read Killing Keiko: The True Story of Free Willy&amp;#8217;s Return to the Wild PDF , Reading Killing Keiko: The True Story of Free Willy&amp;#8217;s Return to the Wild pdf , Killing Keiko: The True Story of Free Willy&amp;#8217;s Return to the Wild Handbook , Killing Keiko: The True Story of Free Willy&amp;#8217;s Return to the Wild read , Killing Keiko: The True Story of Free Willy&amp;#8217;s Return to the Wild epub , Killing Keiko: The True Story of Free Willy&amp;#8217;s Return to the Wild in English , Killing Keiko: The True Story of Free Willy&amp;#8217;s Return to the Wild Kindle , Killing Keiko: The True Story of Free Willy&amp;#8217;s Return to the Wild audiobook Killing Keiko: The True Story of Free Willy&amp;#8217;s Return to the Wild Summary.

<p>Summary : &#8220;Once upon a time there lived in Berlin, Germany, a man called Albinus. He was rich, respectable, happy; one day he abandoned his wife for the sake of a youthful mistress; he loved; was not loved; and his life ended in disaster.&#8221; Thus begins Vladimir Nabokov&#8217;s Laughter in the Dark; this, the author tells us, is the whole story except that he starts from here, with his characteristic dazzling skill and irony, and brilliantly turns a fable into a chilling, original novel of folly and destruction. Amidst a Weimar-era milieu of silent film stars, artists, and aspirants, Nabokov creates a merciless masterpiece as Albinus, an aging critic, falls prey to his own desires, to his teenage mistress, and to Axel Rex, the scheming rival for her affections who finds his greatest joy in the downfall of others. Published first in Russian as Kamera Obskura in 1932, this book appeared in Nabokov&#8217;s own English translation six years later. This New Directions edition, based on the text as Nabokov </p>

<p>Summary : El?as es un hombre serio e intransigente, pero justo. Tambi?n es, seg?n la opini?n generalizada de quienes lo rodean, aburrido, arrogante y puntilloso. Es, adem?s, due?o de una pr?spera escuela de h?pica, padre de una adolescente complicada ?y mucho m?s problem?tica de lo que ella le deja ver? y viudo desde hace tres a?os. Se siente solo, pero eso es algo que est? decidido a solucionar.Beth es distante, esquiva y un tanto c?nica. Y guarda un secreto que condiciona su relaci?n con los hombres. Un secreto que la amedrenta y le despierta una sospecha: ella no es como las dem?s mujeres. Ella est? ?averiada?. Algo que le ha quedado claro tras una amarga relaci?n que tambi?n le ha hecho ver que el estado ideal ?al menos para ella?es la solter?a. Y as? est? decidida a seguir por los siglos de los siglos, am?n.El problema es que El?as est? interesado en Beth. Y es incluso m?s terco que ella. Y, adem?s de arrogante, es atractivo, carism?tico e insistente. Y, por a?adidura, besa de maravilla.</p>

<p>Summary : Brian Greene, one of the world&#8217;s leading string theorists, peels away the layers of mystery surrounding string theory to reveal a universe that consists of eleven dimensions, where the fabric of space tears and repairs itself, and all matter, from the smallest quarks to the most gargantuan supernovas, is generated by the vibrations of microscopically tiny loops of energy.Today, physicists and mathematicians throughout the world are feverishly working on one of the most ambitious theories ever proposed: superstring theory.

<p>Summary : Brian Greene, one of the world&#8217;s leading string theorists, peels away the layers of mystery surrounding string theory to reveal a universe that consists of eleven dimensions, where the fabric of space tears and repairs itself, and all matter, from the smallest quarks to the most gargantuan supernovas, is generated by the vibrations of microscopically tiny loops of energy.Today, physicists and mathematicians throughout the world are feverishly working on one of the most ambitious theories ever proposed: superstring theory. String theory, as it is often called, is the key to the Unified Field Theory that eluded Einstein for more than thirty years. Finally, the century-old antagonism between the large and the small&#8211;General Relativity and Quantum Theory&#8211;is resolved. String theory proclaims that all of the wondrous happenings in the universe, from the frantic dancing of subatomic quarks to the majestic swirling of heavenly galaxies, are reflections of one grand physical principle and </p>

<p>Summary : A radical retelling of the history of science that challenges the Eurocentric narrative. We are told that modern science was invented in Europe, the product of great minds like Nicolaus Copernicus, Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin and Albert Einstein. But this is wrong. The history of science is not, and has never been, a uniquely European endeavour. Copernicus relied on mathematical techniques borrowed from Arabic and Persian texts. When Newton set out the laws of motion, he relied on astronomical observations made in India and Africa. When Darwin was writing On the Origin of Species, he consulted a sixteenth-century Chinese encyclopaedia. And when Einstein was studying quantum mechanics, he was inspired by the young Bengali physicist, Satyendra Nath Bose. Horizons pushes the history of science beyond Europe, exploring the ways in which scientists from Africa, America, Asia and the Pacific fit into this global story. Scientists today are quick to recognise the international nature of </p>

<p>Summary : Leave a Cheater, Gain a Life is a snarky, no-nonsense self-help guide on how to bounce back and get on with your life after you?ve been cheated on. It?s not about reconciling, saving your relationship, or making nice with your cheater, but rather how to pick yourself up off the floor and get your power back. Instead of focusing the attention on the cheater?how their needs weren?t met, how you drove them to cheat, their concerns with monogamy?this guide takes a hard stance and puts the blame right where it belongs?on the cheater.Tracy Schorn is the Chump Lady, someone who has experienced infidelity in her former marriage firsthand and has lived to tell the tale. Schorn?s bitingly funny wit and tell-it-like-it-is attitude will be just the humor readers need to help them get through infidelity. Complete with Schorn?s full-color, comedic cartoons and invaluable advice, this book will be a complete comfort for chumps everywhere.</p>

<p>Summary : I don&#8217;t encourage murder. I have no interest in one person killing another. I only want to draw out morbid desires, imprisoned deep in the unconscious. This lust, once freed, starts growing. Their imaginations run free, and they soon discover their potential&#8230; They are waiting for someone like me.A spectral, nameless narrator haunts the lost and wounded of big-city Seoul, suggesting solace in suicide. Wandering through the bright lights of their high-urban existence, C and K are brothers who fall in love with the same woman &#8211; Se-yeon. As their lives intersect, they tear at each other in a struggle to find connection in their fast-paced, atomized world.Dreamlike and cinematic, I Have the Right to Destroy Myself brilliantly affirms Young-ha Kim as Korea&#8217;s leading young literary master.</p>

<p>Summary : This book presents a highly practical approach to assessing children&#8217;s spelling and word knowledge abilities and offering effective, appropriate instruction. Included is the Developmental Spelling Analysis (DSA), a dictated word inventory that enables teachers to quickly and easily evaluate students&#8217; stages of spelling development and their knowledge of important orthographic features. Detailed guidelines are set forth for engaging students in hands-on word study that is tailored to their specific strengths and weaknesses. Validated and field-tested, the instructional techniques described here reflect the author&#8217;s many years of classroom experience. Particularly useful features of the book include narrative &#8220;snapshots&#8221; of children at different stages of spelling development; numerous examples of student work; suggested word sort activities for each orthographic feature; lists of recommended books and poems; and a focus on fostering a love of words through word play and language </p>

<p>Summary : Bob and Fran have worked hard to give their four children the opportunities they never had. Now, with the kids ready to make lives of their own, it&#8217;s time to sit back and smell the roses. But the change of the seasons reveals some shattering truths, leaving us asking whether it&#8217;s possible to love too much.Things I Know To Be True is Andrew Bovell&#8217;s complex and intense portrait of the mechanics of a family &#8211; and a marriage &#8211; through the eyes of four siblings struggling to define themselves beyond their parents&#8217; love and expectations.Beautifully touching, funny and bold, the play was premiered in Adelaide, Australia, as a co-production between Frantic Assembly and the State Theatre Company of South Australia. It received its British premiere in 2016, co-produced with Warwick Arts Centre in association with Chichester Festival Theatre and the Lyric Hammersmith.</p>

<p>Summary : How do plants, even if still buried underground, know that it&#8217;s their time to bloom? What signals them to begin the challenging task of making flowers, and how do they make the variety of flower shapes, colors, and scents? What kind of instructions does the plant carry?Flowers enrich the beauty of meadows and gardens, but of course, they are not there simply to please us. Biologically, blossoms form a critical aspect of the reproductive cycle of many plants. In this book, the distinguished scientist Maxine Singer explains what we have pieced together about the genetics behind flowering. She describes in a clear and accessible account the key genes which, regulated by other genes, modulated by epigenetic effects, and responding to environmental cues, cause plants to flower at a particular time, and define the variety of flowers. The remarkably intricate processes involved in making flowers have evolved in nature alongside the pollinating birds and insects that the flowers must attract </p>

<p>Summary : Having shared his journey of faith in the New York Times bestselling Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus, Nabeel Qureshi now examines Islam and Christianity in detail, exploring areas of crucial conflict and unpacking the relevant evidence.In this anticipated follow-up book, Nabeel reveals what he discovered in the decade following his conversion, providing a thorough and careful comparison of the evidence for Islam and Christianity&#8211;evidence that wrenched his heart and transformed his life.In Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus, Nabeel Qureshi recounted his dramatic journey, describing his departure from Islam and his decision to follow Christ. In the years that followed, he realized that the world?s two largest religions are far more different than they initially appeared.No God but One: Allah or Jesus? addresses the most important questions at the interface of Islam and Christianity: How do the two religions differ?

<p>Summary : Getting Lost is the diary kept by Annie Ernaux during the year and a half she had a secret love affair with a younger, married man, an attach? to the Soviet embassy in Paris. Her novel, Simple Passion, was based on this affair, but here her writing is immediate and unfiltered. In these diaries it is 1989 and Annie is divorced with two grown sons, living in the suburbs of Paris and nearing fifty. Her lover escapes the city to see her there and Ernaux seems to survive only in expectation of these encounters. She cannot write, she trudges distractedly through her various other commitments in the world, she awaits his next call; she lives merely to feel desire and for the next rendezvous. When he is gone and the moment of desire has faded, she feels that she is a step closer to death.Lauded for her spare prose, Ernaux here removes all artifice, her writing pared down to its most naked and vulnerable. Translated brilliantly for the first time by Alison L. Strayer, Getting Lost is a </p>

<p>Summary : A woman writer goes to Athens in the height of summer to teach a writing course. Though her own circumstances remain indistinct, she becomes the audience to a chain of narratives, as the people she meets tell her one after another the stories of their lives.Beginning with the neighbouring passenger on the flight out and his tales of fast boats and failed marriages, the storytellers talk of their loves and ambitions and pains, their anxieties, their perceptions and daily lives. In the stifling heat and noise of the city the sequence of voice begins to weave a complex human tapestry. The more they talk the more elliptical their listener becomes, as she shapes and directs their accounts until certain themes begin to emerge: the experience of loss, the nature of family life, the difficulty of intimacy and the mystery of creativity itself.Outline is a novel about writing and talking, about self-effacement and self-expression, about the desire to create and the human art of </p>

A past that caused it to christen itself ?Murderbot.&#8221; But it has only vague memories of the massacre that spawned that title, and it wants to know more. Teaming up with a Research Transport vessel named ART (you don?t want to know what the ?A? stands for), Murderbot heads to the mining facility where it went rogue.

<p>Summary : Today many of us live indoor lives, disconnected from the natural world as never before. And yet nature remains deeply ingrained in our language, culture and consciousness. For centuries, we have acted on an intuitive sense that we need communion with the wild to feel well. Now, in the moment of our great migration away from the rest of nature, more and more scientific evidence is emerging to confirm its place at the heart of our psychological wellbeing. So what happens, asks acclaimed journalist Lucy Jones, as we lose our bond with the natural world&#8211;might we also be losing part of ourselves?Delicately observed and rigorously researched, Losing Eden is an enthralling journey through this new research, exploring how and why connecting with the living world can so drastically affect our health. Travelling from forest schools in East London, to the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, via Poland&#8217;s primeval woodlands, Californian laboratories and ecotherapists&#8217; couches, Jones takes us to the </p>

<p>Summary : Faber Stories, a landmark series of individual volumes, presents masters of the short story form at work in a range of genres and styles.Lips the colour of blood, the sun an unprecedented orange, train wheels that sound like &#8216;guilt, and guilt, and guilt&#8217;: these are just some of the things Mary Ventura begins to notice on her journey to the ninth kingdom.&#8217;But what is the ninth kingdom?&#8217; she asks a kind-seeming lady in her carriage. &#8216;It is the kingdom of the frozen will,&#8217; comes the reply. &#8216;There is no going back.&#8217;Sylvia Plath&#8217;s strange, dark tale of independence over infanticide, written not long after she herself left home, grapples with mortality in motion.Bringing together past, present and future in our ninetieth year, Faber Stories is a celebratory compendium of collectable work.</p>

<p>Summary : Harrowing poems from a dark corner of American history by the winner of the 2016 Lexi Rudnitsky First Book Prize in Poetry. Haunted by the voices of those committed to the notorious Virginia State Colony, epicenter of the American eugenics movement in the first half of the twentieth century, this evocative debut marks the emergence of a poet of exceptional poise and compassion, who grew up in the shadow of the Colony itself.</p>

<p>Summary : I?m an outcast and a loner, named for death itself. Fate wasn?t supposed to have plans for me.But then she came back?the girl I once kissed in a thorn-covered chapel in the woods. She came back, and I could no more resist her than I could pry out my own heart. And by some trick of fate, she wants me as much as I want her. The only problem? She also wants the man who owns Thornchapel, Auden Guest.And so do I.Eight years ago, I did something to Auden, something terrible. He hurt me back the only way he knew how, and so here we are: our hatred seasoned with pain and my loneliness seasoned with longing. The only thing we can agree on is Proserpina Markham, and she wants us to find a way to be together?all three of us. If Auden wants to earn her as his submissive, then he has to earn me as well.But with the discovery of bones behind the altar and the carnal revel of Beltane fast approaching, it?s becoming clear that Thornchapel?s secrets are much deeper and older than any of us could have </p>

She came back, and I could no more resist her than I could pry out my own heart. And by some trick of fate, she wants me as much as I want her. The only problem? She also wants the man who owns Thornchapel, Auden Guest.And so do I.Eight years ago, I did something to Auden, something terrible. He hurt me back the only way he knew how, and so here we are: our hatred seasoned with pain and my loneliness seasoned with longing. The only thing we can agree on is Proserpina Markham, and she wants us to find a way to be together?all three of us. If Auden wants to earn her as his submissive, then he has to earn me as well.But with the discovery of bones behind the altar and the carnal revel of Beltane fast approaching, it?s becoming clear that Thornchapel?s secrets are much deeper and older than any of us could have </p>

Only those most skilled in riding and bow hunting ride for the Relay; and only the fastest survive, for when dark falls, the nightdrakes?deadly flightless dragons?come out to hunt. Fortunately, Kate has a secret edge: she is a wilder, born with magic that allows her to influence the minds of animals.

And it?s this magic that leads her to a caravan massacred by nightdrakes in broad daylight?the only survivor her childhood friend, her first love, the boy she swore to forget, the boy who broke her heart.The high king?s second son, Corwin Tormane, never asked to lead. Even as he waits for the uror?the once-in-a-generation </p>

<p>Summary : They call her Traitor Kate. It?s a title Kate Brighton inherited from her father after he tried to assassinate the high king years ago. Now Kate lives as an outcast, clinging to the fringes of society as a member of the Relay, the imperial courier service. Only those most skilled in riding and bow hunting ride for the Relay; and only the fastest survive, for when dark falls, the nightdrakes?deadly flightless dragons?come out to hunt.

But it?s this magic that she needs to keep hidden, as being a wilder is forbidden, punishable by death or exile. And it?s this magic that leads her to a caravan massacred by nightdrakes in broad daylight?the only survivor her childhood friend, her first love, the boy she swore to forget, the boy who broke her heart.The high king?s second son, Corwin Tormane, never asked to lead. Even as he waits for the uror?the once-in-a-generation </p>

<p>Summary : If your inner wolf and your body react rather enthusiastically to a psychotic Alpha male who?s own wolf has a tendency to turn feral, it can?t be a good thing, can it? Entering into a bargain with him wouldn?t be good either. Unfortunately, Taryn Warner, a latent wolf shifter, doesn?t have many options open to her right now. Okay, she has no options. Basically it comes down to whether she?ll do what it takes to escape the arranged mating with the sick SOB that her father set up. As the answer in this case is yes, it looks as though she?ll have to agree to Trey Coleman?s deal? she?ll have to mate with him instead. Having always disliked shifter politics, Trey Coleman hadn?t bothered trying to form alliances with other packs. Now that his uncle ? a wolf with many alliances ? means to take Trey?s territory and his pack, he has no option but to form some alliances of his own very quickly or he?ll be easily outnumbered in the upcoming battle. He figures that the easiest way to do that </p>
