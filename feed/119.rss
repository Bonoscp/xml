<p>Summary : CLORAL Fourteen-year-old Bobby Pendragon is not like the other boys his age. His uncle Press is a Traveler, and, as Bobby has learned, that means Uncle Press is responsible, through his journeys, for solving interdimensional conflict wherever he encounters it. His mission is nothing less than to save the universe from ultimate evil. And he&#8217;s taking Bobby along for the ride.   Fresh from his first adventure on Denduron, Bobby finds himself in the territory of Cloral,a vast world that is entirely covered by water. Cloral is nearing a disaster of huge proportions. Reading the journals Bobby sends home, his friends learn that the desperate citizens of the endangered floating cities are on the brink of war. Can Bobby &#8212; suburban basketball star and all-around nice guy &#8212; help rid the area of marauders, and locate the legendary lost land of Faar, which may hold the key to Cloral&#8217;s survival?</p>

Precious Ramotswe loves her dependable old van. Yes, it sometimes takes a bit longer to get going now, and it has developed some quirks over the years, but it has always gotten the job done. This time, though, the world&#8211;and Charlie&#8211;may be asking too much of it, for when he borrows the beloved vehicle, he returns it damaged.

Matekoni and Mma Makutsi suspicious. And there is no peace at home, either, as the new neighbors are airing their </p>

<p>Summary : Organized around the coherent and cohesive Generalist Intervention Model, this guide to generalist social work practice incorporates the knowledge, skills, and professional values needed to work with individuals and families, as well as the foundation to work with groups, communities, and organizations. Updated with new material on empathy, interdisciplinary collaboration, working with LGBTQ clients and adults with disabilities, and other topics, the book focuses on micro levels of social work practice while also discussing the interrelationship among the micro, mezzo, and macro levels. Part of the Brooks/Cole Empowerment Series, UNDERSTANDING GENERALIST PRACTICE, 8th Edition, clearly identifies content related to the latest Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards (EPAS) with icons throughout the text. Learning objectives, correlated to chapter headings and summaries, guide students&#8217; reading and reinforce their understanding.</p>

<p>Summary : A fragile peace reigns in Wessex, Mercia and East Anglia. King Alfred?s son Edward and formidable daughter, Aethelflaed, rule the kingdoms. But all around the restless Northmen, eyeing the rich lands and wealthy churches, are mounting raids.Uhtred of Bebbanburg, the kingdoms? greatest warrior, controls northern Mercia from the strongly fortified city of Chester. But forces are gathering against him. Northmen allied to the Irish, led by the fierce warrior Ragnall Ivarson, are soon joined by the Northumbrians, and their strength could prove overwhelming. Despite the gathering threat, both Edward and Aethelflaed are reluctant to move out of the safety of their fortifications. But with Uhtred?s own daughter married to Ivarson?s brother, who can be trusted?In the struggle between family and loyalty, between personal ambition and political commitment, there will be no easy path. But a man with a warrior?s courage may be able to find it. Such a man is Uhtred, and this may be his finest hour.</p>

<p>Summary : If George magazine was about ?not just politics as usual,? a day at the office with John F. Kennedy Jr. was not just business as usual. John handpicked Creative Director Matt Berman to bring his vision for a new political magazine to life. Through marathon nights leading up to George&#8217;s launch; extraordinary meetings with celebrities including Barbra Streisand, Robert De Niro, and Demi Moore; and jokes at each other?s expense, Matt developed a wonderfully collaborative and fun-loving relationship with America?s favorite son.They were an unlikely team: the poised, charismatic scion of a beloved political family and the shy, self-deprecating, artistic kid. Yet they became close friends and confidants. In this warm, funny, and intimate book, Matt remembers his brilliant friend and colleague?John?s approach to work, life, and fame, and most of all, his ease and grace, which charmed those around him.More than any book before it, JFK Jr., George, &amp; Me reveals the friendly, witty, </p>

<p>Summary : Lawrence Durrell&#8217;s series of four novels set in Alexandria, Egypt during the 1940s. The lush and sensuous series consists of Justine(1957) Balthazar(1958) Mountolive(1958) Clea(1960).Justine, Balthazar and Mountolive use varied viewpoints to relate a series of events in Alexandria before World War II. In Clea, the story continues into the years during the war. One L.G. Darley is the primary observer of the events, which include events in the lives of those he loves and those he knows. In Justine, Darley attempts to recover from and put into perspective his recently ended affair with a woman. Balthazar reinterprets the romantic perspective he placed on the affair and its aftermath in Justine, in more philosophical and intellectual terms. Mountolive tells a story minus interpretation, and Clea reveals Darley&#8217;s healing, and coming to love another woman.</p>

<p>Summary : Bully and victim. Tormenter and tormented. Villain and hero. Ellie McCallum was a bully. No connection to anyone or anything. A sad and lonely existence for a young woman who had come to expect nothing more for herself. Her only happiness coming from making others miserable. Particularly Freaky Flynn. Flynn Hendrick lived a life completely disconnected even as he struggled to become something more than that boy with Asperger&#8217;s. He was taunted and teased, bearing the brunt of systematic and calculated cruelty, ultimately culminating in a catastrophic turn of events that brought Ellie and Flynn?s worlds crashing down. But then Flynn and Ellie grew up. And moved on. Until years later when their paths unexpectedly cross again and the bully and the freak are face to face once more.

And out of the wreckage of their </p>

<p>Summary : Rarely do books have such a great influence on a genre as &#8220;Lest Darkness Fall&#8221; has had on science fiction. Frequently quoted as one of the favorite books of many of the masters of the field, this book by L. Sprague de Camp helped establish time-travel as solid sub-genre of science fiction.An indication of the influence and longevity of the book is the number of best-selling writers who have written stories in direct response to, or influenced by, Lest Darkness Fall. This new volume also includes three such stories by Frederik Pohl, David Drake and S. M. Stirling written over a period of forty-three years &#8212; a testament to the timelessness of the book. Similar, thematically, to Mark Twain&#8217;s &#8220;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#8217;s Court,&#8221; the book tells the tale of Martin Padway who, as he is walking around in modern Rome, is suddenly transported though time to 6th Century Rome.Once in ancient Rome, Padway (now Martinus Paduei Quastor) embarks on an ambitious project of single-handedly </p>

<p>Summary : ?One of the Finest Memoirs Ever Written? ? The New YorkerThe highly acclaimed memoir of one of the most original American storytellers of the rural SouthA Penguin ClassicHarry Crews grew up as the son of a sharecropper in Georgia at a time when ?the rest of the country was just beginning to feel the real hurt of the Great Depression but it had been living in Bacon County for years.?

<p>Summary : Pearl and May are sisters, living carefree lives in Shanghai, the Paris of Asia. But when Japanese bombs fall on their beloved city, they set out on the journey of a lifetime, one that will take them through the Chinese countryside, in and out of the clutch of brutal soldiers, and across the Pacific to the shores of America.In 1937, Shanghai is the Paris of Asia, a city of great wealth and glamour, the home of millionaires and beggars, gangsters and gamblers, patriots and revolutionaries, artists and warlords. Thanks to the financial security and material comforts provided by their father?s prosperous rickshaw business, twenty-one-year-old Pearl Chin and her younger sister, May, are having the time of their lives. Though both sisters wave off authority and tradition, they couldn?t be more different: Pearl is a Dragon sign, strong and stubborn, while May is a true Sheep, adorable and placid. Both are beautiful, modern, and carefree . . . until the day their father tells them that he </p>

<p>Summary : Wallis Simpson, Theodore Roosevelt, Benito Mussolini, Evelyn Waugh, the great tenor Luciano Pavarotti, and the first man in space, Yuri Gagarin, were all agreed: the best thing about Budapest is its position. With the Danube, Budapest forms one of the most beautiful cityscapes that exist along a river.The older side, Buda, looks over at the picture-postcard panorama of modern Pest, developed in the late nineteenth century as the twin capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. But the city is full of reminders of a more distant past, from the second century AD when the Romans located thermal springs in Buda. For around two hundred years from the 1520s most of Hungary was occupied by the Ottoman Turks &#8211; just one of the periods when geography and politics placed the country directly on the faultline between East and West.Throughout history the centre of gravity in Budapest and among Hungarians has shifted between East and West &#8211; culturally, politically, emotionally.

<p>Summary : Indian History has to be rewritten according to the latest linguistic and archaeological discoveries, if Indian children are to understand who they are and where they come from. The history of India&#8217;s beginnings were written by European colonizers, with an intention to downsize, downgrade and postdate Indian civilization, but that unfortunately, generation after generation of Indian historians, for their own selfish purpose, endorsed and perpetuated these wrong theories, such as the Aryan invasion, which divided India like nothing else, pitting South against North, Aryan against Dravidian, Untouchables against Brahmins.</p>

<p>Summary : People of the Twenty-First Century is an enormous and completely fascinating collection of &#8216;anti-sartorial&#8217; photographs of street life by the Dutch conceptual artist/street photographer. From Amsterdam to New York and Paris to Shanghai, these photographs, taken over a period of more than twenty years, provide a cumulative portrait of the people of the twenty-first century. A magnetic panoply of images, this cult object has a place in the library of every photography book collector as well as anyone interested in contemporary culture. Democratic, apolitical and unique, the archive of thousands of images offers an engrossing and engaging cross-section of society. Over the course of the last two decades, Hans Eijkelboom worked methodically on his monumental Photo Notes project: First he would select a busy pedestrian area ? his favourite spots were often near shopping centres ? where he would stay for 30 minutes up to a few hours. He then spent time observing passers-by before </p>

<p>Summary : Running from poverty and hopelessness, Ram?n Espejo boarded one of the great starships of the mysterious, repulsive Enye. But the new life he found on the far-off planet of S?o Paulo was no better than the one he abandoned. Then one night his rage and too much alcohol get the better of him. Deadly violence ensues, forcing Ram?n to flee into the wilderness.Mercifully, almost happily alone ? far from the loud, bustling hive of humanity that he detests with sociopathic fervor ? the luckless prospector is finally free to search for the one rich strike that could make him wealthy. But what he stumbles upon instead is an advanced alien race in hiding: desperate fugitives, like him, on a world not their own. Suddenly in possession of a powerful, dangerous secret and caught up in an extraordinary manhunt on a hostile, unpredictable planet, Ram?n must first escape&#8230; and then, somehow, survive.And his deadliest enemy is himself.</p>

<p>Summary : The author team of Dave Sobecki and Allan Bluman created an engaging text and digital program aimed at meeting the needs of today&#8217;s liberal arts math students, resulting in the third edition of Math in Our World. This revision focused on further development of critical thinking skills through several hundred revised exercises and examples, still presented within the hallmark style of the Math in Our World program. Carefully chosen questions help students to form a connection between relevant examples and the mathematical concepts of the chapter.

<p>Summary : I ricordi traumatici non elaborati si inscrivono nel corpo e nella mente, continuando a presentare il conto per tutta la vita. Per lavorare sui sintomi del trauma ? dunque fondamentale comprendere in che modo la memoria e i ricordi interagiscano con il funzionamento della psiche e del corpo, rimanendo ancorati alle sensazioni fisiche e agli schemi motori. Il Somatic Experiencing, metodo con cui l&#8217;autore lavora da decenni sui sintomi post-traumatici, utilizza gli strumenti del movimento, della respirazione e dell&#8217;interazione per guidare il paziente a decostruire i ricordi traumatici e renderli accessibili alla trasformazione e al cambiamento. Corredato di casi clinici e resoconti di sedute, nonch? di un ricco apparato fotografico, ? un testo rivolto ai terapeuti, ma del tutto accessibile a chiunque sia interessato allo studio clinico e scientifico del ruolo della memoria nel funzionamento dell&#8217;essere umano.</p>

<p>Summary : Ser Harry Potter nunca ha sido tarea f?cil, menos a?n desde que se ha convertido en un ocupad?simo empleado del Ministerio de Magia, un hombre casado y padre de tres hijos. Mientras Harry planta cara a un pasado que se resiste a quedar atr?s, su hijo menor, Albus, ha de luchar contra el peso de una herencia familiar de la que ?l nunca ha querido saber nada. Cuando el destino conecte el pasado con el presente, padre e hijo deber?n afrontar una verdad muy inc?moda: a veces, la oscuridad surge de los lugares m?s insospechados.</p>

This Very Short Introduction sets out to dispel the myths that surround atheism, arguing that most western atheism is so-named only because it exists in a tradition in which theism is the norm. Julian Baggini instead asserts that atheists are typically naturalists, who believe that meaning and morality are possible in a finite, natural world.This second edition includes a new chapter covering the impact and legacy of &#8216;New Atheism&#8217;, a powerful new movement in atheism in the early twenty first century, driven by books from authors such as Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris, and which is having a profound impact across the Western world.

<p>Summary : London, 2019. Life has been easy for Maxim Trevelyan. With his good looks, aristocratic connections, and money, he?s never had to work and he?s rarely slept alone. But all that changes when tragedy strikes and Maxim inherits his family?s noble title, wealth, and estates, and all the responsibility that entails. It?s a role he?s not prepared for and one that he struggles to face.But his biggest challenge is fighting his desire for an unexpected, enigmatic young woman who?s recently arrived in England, possessing little more than a dangerous and troublesome past. Reticent, beautiful, and musically gifted, she?s an alluring mystery, and Maxim?s longing for her deepens into a passion that he?s never experienced and dares not name. Just who is Alessia Demachi? Can Maxim protect her from the malevolence that threatens her? And what will she do when she learns that he?s been hiding secrets of his own?From the heart of London through wild, rural Cornwall to the bleak, forbidding beauty of </p>

When his delicate mission is suddenly overshadowed by seven bizarre deaths, Brother William turns detective. His tools are the logic of Aristotle, the theology of Aquinas, the empirical insights of Roger Bacon?all sharpened to a glistening edge by wry humor and a ferocious curiosity. He collects evidence, deciphers secret symbols and coded manuscripts, and digs into the eerie labyrinth of the abbey, where ?the most interesting things happen at night.? ?Like the labyrinthine library at its heart, this brilliant novel has many cunning passages and secret chambers . . . Fascinating . . . ingenious . . . dazzling.? ? Newsweek</p>

<p>Summary : The New York Times bestselling author of A Man Called Ove, My Grandmother Asked Me To Tell You She?s Sorry, and Britt-Marie Was Here offers an exquisitely moving portrait of an elderly man?s struggle to hold on to his most precious memories, and his family?s efforts to care for him?even as they must find a way to let go.?Isn?t that the best of all life?s ages, an old man thinks as he looks at his grandchild, when a boy is just big enough to know how the world works but still young enough to refuse to accept it.? Grandpa and Noah are sitting on a bench in a square that keeps getting smaller every day. The square is strange but also familiar, full of the odds and ends that have made up their lives: Grandpa?s work desk, the stuffed dragon that Grandpa once gave to Noah, the sweet-smelling hyacinths that Grandma loved to grow in her garden.As they wait together on the bench, they tell jokes and discuss their shared love of mathematics. Grandpa recalls what it was like to fall in love </p>

<p>Summary : Pop culture is the Pandora?s Box of our lives. Racism, wealth, poverty, beauty, inclusion, exclusion, and hope &#8212; all of these intractable and unavoidable features course through the media we consume. Examining pop culture?s impact on her life, Nichole Perkins takes readers on a rollicking trip through the last twenty years of music, media and the internet from the perspective of one southern Black woman. She explores her experience with mental illness and how the TV series Frasier served as a crutch, how her role as mistress led her to certain internet message boards that prepared her for current day social media, and what it means to figure out desire and sexuality and Prince in a world where marriage is the only acceptable goal for women.?Combining her sharp wit, stellar pop culture sensibility, and trademark spirited storytelling, Nichole boldly tackles the damage done to women, especially Black women, by society?s failure to confront the myths and misogyny at its heart, and her </p>

<p>Summary : When she fell asleep, the world was doomed. When she awoke, it was dead.In the wake of a fever that decimated the earth?s population?killing women and children and making childbirth deadly for the mother and infant?the midwife must pick her way through the bones of the world she once knew to find her place in this dangerous new one. Gone are the pillars of civilization. All that remains is power?and the strong who possess it.A few women like her survived, though they are scarce. Even fewer are safe from the clans of men, who, driven by fear, seek to control those remaining. To preserve her freedom, she dons men?s clothing, goes by false names, and avoids as many people as possible. But as the world continues to grapple with its terrible circumstances, she?ll discover a role greater than chasing a pale imitation of independence.After all, if humanity is to be reborn, someone must be its guide.</p>

<p>Summary : When J.R.R. Tolkien laid aside The Silmarillion in 1937 the extension of the original &#8216;mythology&#8217; into later Ages of the world had scarcely begun. It was in the Appendices to The Lord of the Rings that there emerged a comprehensive historical structure and chronology of the Second and Third Ages, embracing all the diverse strands that came together in the War of the Ring. The difficulty that he found in providing these Appendices, leading to the delay in the publication of The Return of the King, is well known, but in The Peoples of Middle-earth Christopher Tolkien shows that early forms of these works already existed years before, in essays and records differing greatly from the published forms. He traces the evolution of the Calendars, the Hobbit genealogies, the Westron language or Common Speach (from which many words and names are recorded that were afterwards lost), and the chronological structure of the later Ages.Other writings by J.R.R. Tolkien are included in this final </p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;Neurocopywriting&#8221; ? un manuale che spiega l&#8217;applicazione del neuromarketing e delle neuroscienze allo storytelling. Attraverso uno stile discorsivo ma rigorosamente documentato a livello scientifico, in queste pagine scoprirete come creare contenuti efficaci, grazie alle conoscenze sul cervello e le sue modalit? di reazione, apprendimento e attenzione: una delle nuove frontiere aperte dalle neuroscienze. Il libro si addentra in un percorso stimolante, ricco di esempi pratici, interviste, esperimenti e casi aziendali, risultando particolarmente utile per tutti coloro che, pur non essendo addetti ai lavori, devono ogni giorno confrontarsi con le sfide della comunicazione.</p>

<p>Summary : Antonio Gramsci (1891-1937) is widely celebrated as the most original political thinker in Western Marxism and an all-around outstanding intellectual figure. Arrested and imprisoned by the Italian Fascist regime in 1926, Gramsci died before fully regaining his freedom. Nevertheless, in his prison notebooks, he recorded thousands of brilliant reflections on an extraordinary range of subjects, establishing an enduring intellectual legacy.Columbia University Press&#8217;s multivolume Prison Notebooks is the only complete critical edition of Antonio Gramsci&#8217;s seminal writings in English. The notebooks&#8217; integral text gives readers direct access not only to Gramsci&#8217;s influential ideas but also to the intellectual workshop where those ideas were forged. Extensive notes guide readers through Gramsci&#8217;s extraordinary series of reflections on an encyclopedic range of topics. Volume 3 contains notebooks 6, 7, and 8, in which Gramsci develops his concepts of hegemony, civil society, and the state; </p>

<p>Summary : Weston  When I left home, I swore I&#8217;d never hide anything about myself again. From college, to law school, to the United States Senate representing California, I&#8217;ve done it all as an out gay man. So, when I&#8217;m in DC and see a beautiful guy at the hotel bar, I don&#8217;t hesitate to proposition him&#8230;right before he runs out on me, leaving his sunglasses behind like my very own Cinderfella.  Anson  I&#8217;ve always known I&#8217;m gay, but never acted on it. Pretending isn&#8217;t easy, but it means I can keep playing football. No one has ever guessed my secret until the gorgeous man at a bar in DC. At least he doesn&#8217;t know who I am&#8211;the best tight end in the NFL, playing for the Atlanta Lightning. Though my identity doesn&#8217;t stay a secret from him for long.  Between texts and late-night phone calls, we get to know each other. West&#8217;s the only person who knows all the parts of me, just like I know his. When he asks for one night together so he can show me what it&#8217;s like to be with a man, I can&#8217;t say no.

So, when I&#8217;m in DC and see a beautiful guy at the hotel bar, I don&#8217;t hesitate to proposition him&#8230;right before he runs out on me, leaving his sunglasses behind like my very own Cinderfella.  Anson  I&#8217;ve always known I&#8217;m gay, but never acted on it. Pretending isn&#8217;t easy, but it means I can keep playing football. No one has ever guessed my secret until the gorgeous man at a bar in DC. At least he doesn&#8217;t know who I am&#8211;the best tight end in the NFL, playing for the Atlanta Lightning. Though my identity doesn&#8217;t stay a secret from him for long.  Between texts and late-night phone calls, we get to know each other. West&#8217;s the only person who knows all the parts of me, just like I know his. When he asks for one night together so he can show me what it&#8217;s like to be with a man, I can&#8217;t say no.

In Mysterious America, a fun and compulsively readable guidebook to America&#8217;s most popular local legends, he prepares readers for their own adventure &#8212; where to find the unbelievable spectacles on their journey, including: Phantom panthers haunting eastern North America Bay State ghosts and spirits Mad gassers in Illinois Champ, the famous Lake Champlain monster The Minnesota Iceman The Missouri Momo and the infamous Eastern Bigfoot And many more!  Coleman&#8217;s witty insight and astonishing experiences will captivate followers of Charles Fort and just-plain-curious readers alike.

<p>Summary : We&#8217;re in the middle of an epidemic of stress and anxiety. A global pandemic has wreaked havoc on our lives. Average life expectancy in the United States is down. At work, less than 16 percent of us are fully engaged. In many high-stress jobs, such as distribution centers, emergency room nursing, and teaching, incidences of PTSD are higher than for soldiers returning from war zones.We&#8217;re getting something terribly wrong. We&#8217;ve designed the love out of our workplaces, and our schools too, so that they fail utterly to provide for or capitalize on one of our most basic human needs: our need for love.As Marcus Buckingham shows in this eye-opening, uplifting book, love is an energy, and like all forms of energy, it must flow. It demands expression?and that expression is work. Whether in our professional accomplishments, our relationships, or our response to all the many slings and arrows of life, we know that none of this work will be our best unless it is made with love.

But as monsters emerge from the horrors of the past, and dark forces become poised to claim her world, the only chance for salvation will lie in a desperate quest that may mark the end of everything Aelin holds dear.In this breathtaking fifth installment of the New York Times bestselling Throne of Glass series, Aelin will have to choose what?and who?to sacrifice if she&#8217;s to keep the world of Erilea from breaking apart.</p>

<p>Summary : The current consensus economic model, the neoclassical synthesis, depends on aprioristic assumptions that are shown to be invalid when tested against the data and fails to include finance. Economic policy based on this consensus has led to the financial crisis of 2008, the &#8216;Great Recession&#8217; that followed, and the slow subsequent rate of growth. In The Economics of the Stock Market, Andrew Smithers proposes a model that is robust when tested, and by including the impact of the stock market on the economy, overcomes both these defects. The faults of the current consensus model are shown to result typically from an unscientific methodology in which assumptions are held to be valid despite their incompatibility with data evidence. Smithers demonstrates examples of these faults: the Miller/Modigliani Theorem (the assumption that leverage does not affect the value of produced capital assets); the assumption that short-term and long-term interest rates, and the cost of equity capital, are </p>

<p>Summary : The rise of modern science has brought with it increasing acceptance among intellectual elites of a worldview that conflicts sharply both with everyday human experience and with beliefs widely shared among the world s great cultural traditions. Most contemporary scientists and philosophers believe that reality is at bottom purely physical, and that human beings are nothing more than extremely complicated biological machines. On such views our everyday experiences of conscious decision-making, free will, and the self are illusory by-products of the grinding of our neural machinery. It follows that mind and personality are necessarily extinguished at death, and that there exists no deeper transpersonal or spiritual reality of any sort. Beyond Physicalism is the product of an unusual fellowship of scientists and humanities scholars who dispute these views.

<p>Summary : The rise of modern science has brought with it increasing acceptance among intellectual elites of a worldview that conflicts sharply both with everyday human experience and with beliefs widely shared among the world s great cultural traditions.

On such views our everyday experiences of conscious decision-making, free will, and the self are illusory by-products of the grinding of our neural machinery. It follows that mind and personality are necessarily extinguished at death, and that there exists no deeper transpersonal or spiritual reality of any sort.

<p>Summary : If there?s one thing Mare Barrow knows, it?s that she?s different.Mare Barrow?s blood is red?the color of common folk?but her Silver ability, the power to control lightning, has turned her into a weapon that the royal court tries to control. The crown calls her an impossibility, a fake, but as she makes her escape from Maven, the prince?the friend?who betrayed her, Mare uncovers something startling: she is not the only one of her kind.Pursued by Maven, now a vindictive king, Mare sets out to find and recruit other Red-and-Silver fighters to join in the struggle against her oppressors. But Mare finds herself on a deadly path, at risk of becoming exactly the kind of monster she is trying to defeat. Will she shatter under the weight of the lives that are the cost of rebellion? Or have treachery and betrayal hardened her forever?The electrifying next installment in the Red Queen series escalates the struggle between the growing rebel army and the blood-segregated world they?ve always </p>

<p>Summary : From USA Today bestselling author Willow Winters comes an emotionally gripping, standalone, contemporary romance. It was never love with Daniel and I never thought it would be. It was only lust from a distance. Unrequited love maybe. He?s a man I could never have, for so many reasons. That didn?t stop my heart from beating wildly when his eyes pierced through me. It only slowed back down when he?d look away, making me feel so damn unworthy and reminding me that he would never be mine.Years have passed and one look at him brings it all back. But time changes everything.There?s a heat in his eyes I recognize from so long ago, a tension between us I thought was one-sided. ?Tell me you want it.? His rough voice cuts through the night and I can?t resist. That?s where my story really begins.Possessive is an emotional, gripping story. Filled with heartache, guilt and longing! Possessive will take you on a journey of obsession and jealousy&#8230;it&#8217;s emotional, raw and captivating. &#8211; Beyond The </p>

<p>Summary : Listening length: 10 hours, 4 minutesEmiliaThey say love and hate are the same feelings experienced under different circumstances, and it?s true. The man who comes to me in my dreams also haunts me in my nightmares. He is a brilliant lawyer. A skilled criminal. A beautiful liar. A bully and a savior, a monster and a lover. Ten years ago, he made me run away from the small town where we lived. Now, he came for me in New York, and he isn?t leaving until he takes me with him. ViciousShe is a starving artist. Pretty and evasive like cherry blossom. Ten years ago, she barged into my life unannounced and turned everything upside down. She paid the price. Emilia LeBlanc is completely off-limits, my best friend?s ex-girlfriend. The woman who knows my darkest secret, and the daughter of the cheap Help we hired to take care of our estate. That should deter me from chasing her, but it doesn?t. So she hates me. Big fucking deal. She better get used to me.</p>

They push us past our limits, turn us on, and break us.  They?re our bullies. They?re the class of 2020.  Eight bestselling authors are teaming up to bring you eight unique stories about the guys we love to hate.  This anthology benefits one of the largest anti-bullying organizations in the world, and all proceeds will go toward helping to support victims of bullying.

<p>Summary : An illuminating exploration of the surprisingly familiar sex lives of ordinary medieval people. ? The medieval humoral system of medicine suggested that it was possible to die from having too much?or too little?sex, while the Roman Catholic Church taught that virginity was the ideal state. Holy men and women committed themselves to lifelong abstinence in the name of religion. Everyone was forced to conform to restrictive rules about who they could have sex with, in what way, how often, and even when, and could be harshly punished for getting it wrong. Other experiences are more familiar. Like us, medieval people faced challenges in finding a suitable partner or trying to get pregnant (or trying not to). They also struggled with many of the same social issues, such as whether prostitution should be legalized. Above all, they shared our fondness for dirty jokes and erotic images.

<p>Summary : Questa doppia biografia tratteggia le vite di due delle pi? famose protagoniste del Rinascimento italiano, Isabella d?Este marchesa di Mantova e Lucrezia Borgia duchessa di Ferrara, che divengono cognate in virt? del terzo matrimonio di Lucrezia con Alfonso d?Este.Erede di una grande dinastia, sottile stratega capace di vincere le pi? difficili partite dello scacchiere italiano, mecenate e collezionista, Isabella incarna il prototipo della donna politica cerebralee ragionatrice, che antepone l?interesse dello Stato agli affetti. Lucrezia, figlia di un papa controverso e ?carnale? come Alessandro vi, ? invece capace di intense passioni e forti sentimenti, ma all?occorrenza si dimostra un?accorta governante e arriva a contendere a Isabella il primato di mecenate pi? celebrata della penisola.

<p>Summary : A new adult novel from Entangled&#8217;s Embrace imprint&#8230;Three knocks can change everything? &#8220;She knew. That?s why Mom hadn?t opened the door. She knew he was dead.&#8221; Twenty years as an army brat and Ember Howard knew, too. The soldiers at the door meant her dad was never coming home. What she didn?t know was how she would find the strength to singlehandedly care for her crumbling family when her mom falls apart.  Then Josh Walker enters her life. Hockey star, her new next-door neighbor, and not to mention the most delicious hands that insist on saving her over and over again. He has a way of erasing the pain with a single look, a single touch. As much as she wants to turn off her feelings and endure the heartache on her own, she can?t deny their intense attraction. Until Josh?s secret shatters their world. And Ember must decide if he?s worth the risk that comes with loving a man who could strip her bare.</p>

That?s why Mom hadn?t opened the door. She knew he was dead.&amp;#8221; Twenty years as an army brat and Ember Howard knew, too. The soldiers at the door meant her dad was never coming home. What she didn?t know was how she would find the strength to singlehandedly care for her crumbling family when her mom falls apart. Then Josh Walker enters her life. Hockey star, her new next-door neighbor, and not to mention the most delicious hands that insist on saving her over and over again. He has a way of erasing the pain with a single look, a single touch. As much as she wants to turn off her feelings and endure the heartache on her own, she can?t deny their intense attraction. Until Josh?s secret shatters their world. And Ember must decide if he?s worth the risk that comes with loving a man who could strip her bare.

<p>Summary : Bree can&#8217;t wait for her first day at her new middle school, Enith Brigitha, home to the Mighty Manatees&#8211;until she&#8217;s stuck with the only elective that fits her schedule, the dreaded Swim 101. The thought of swimming makes Bree more than a little queasy, yet she&#8217;s forced to dive headfirst into one of her greatest fears. Lucky for her, Etta, an elderly occupant of her apartment building and former swim team captain, is willing to help.With Etta&#8217;s training and a lot of hard work, Bree suddenly finds her swim-crazed community counting on her to turn the school&#8217;s failing team around. But that&#8217;s easier said than done, especially when their rival, the prestigious Holyoke Prep, has everything they need to leave the Mighty Manatees in their wake.Can Bree defy the odds and guide her team to a state championship, or have the Manatees swum their last lap&#8211;for good?</p>

<p>Summary : The novel The Godfather (1969) and the movie of the same name (1972) entrenched the myth of the Mafiosi as valiant knights, men of honor, and defenders of the traditional concept of family. As a result of this movie and other popular portrayals, the image of mobsters as ?men of honor and tradition? has become iconic throughout America. Yet the truth of the matter belies this more noble image. The Mafia is a ruthless organization. Their concept of family is a twisted one. But viewed through the lens of popular culture, it is often difficult to separate the fiction from the reality. Made Men demystifies this image by dismantling the code of honor that Mafiosi live by, including its attendant symbols, rituals, and the lifestyle that it demands.Since the end of World War II, the Mafia in Italy and America has undergone major changes, which are charted by the authors through the present day. Nicaso and Danesi also consider all kinds of related organizations, not only the Italian ones, </p>

<p>Summary : Artificial Intelligence is going to war. Intelligent weapon systems are here today, and many more are on the way tomorrow. Already, they&#8217;re reshaping conflict&#8211;from the chaos of battle, with pilotless drones, robot tanks and unmanned submersibles, to the headquarters far from the action, where generals and politicians use technology to weigh up what to do. AI changes how we fight, and even how likely it is that we will.In battle, warbots will be faster, more agile and more deadly than today&#8217;s crewed weapons. New tactics and concepts will emerge, with spoofing and swarming to fool and overwhelm enemies. Strategies are changing too. When will an intelligent machine escalate, and how can it be deterred? Can robots predict the future? And what happens to the &#8216;art of war&#8217; as machines themselves become creative?Autonomous warfare makes many people uneasy. An international campaign against &#8216;killer robots&#8217; hopes to ban AI from conflict. But the genie is out&#8211;AI weapons are too useful for </p>

<p>Summary : It was supposed to be an innocent night, celebrating my brother?s birthday. Nothing was supposed to go wrong. We?d vowed to be on our best behavior after all . . .But it only took one rowdy night with my brothers to flip my world upside down. One unlucky encounter saddled us with a family curse and the promise of doomed relationships. I laughed it off immediately. ?Yeah, right,? I thought. ?A love curse. Ha!?Boy, was I wrong.Word spreads quickly in a town like mine; rumors about that night soon made us the most eligible yet untouchable bachelors in Port Snow, Maine. As a subject of endless gossip and speculation, I could kiss my dating life goodbye.It would have stayed that way if Ren Winters, the new girl in town, hadn?t crashed into my life. Brave, beautiful, and smart?her vivacious thirst for a fresh start has given me hope that maybe, just maybe, I can have one too.Everyone wishes for that second chance . . . but could this really be mine?</p>

<p>Summary : La rivolta ? stata sconfitta, ma forse per gli umani c&#8217;? ancora una speranza, e si chiama Luka Kane. Dopo essere sfuggito dal Loop e aver guidato la ribellione contro Happy, Luka Kane ? stato ricatturato e rinchiuso nel Blocco, dove i detenuti sono sottoposti a vere e proprie torture per raccogliere la loro energia vitale e alimentare l&#8217;intelligenza artificiale che domina il mondo. Quando Luka ha ormai perso ogni speranza e rinuncia a distinguere la realt? dalle fantasie somministrategli da Happy, i suoi amici riescono finalmente a liberarlo. Un vero capo sa quando ? il momento di sacrificarsi. Ma la guerra pu? avere un costo altissimo, e quando tutto sembra perduto toccher? a Luka fare scelte terribili e sacrificare quanto ha di pi? caro, compreso se stesso, per tentare di smascherare i piani di Happy e svelare il suo terribile segreto.</p>

<p>Summary : Once upon a time, Columbus was a hero&#8230;Sadly, that?s not the case Some people don&#8217;t even know who he was, or what he did; while others claim he was a villain, and are advocating for the abolition of Columbus Day and everything he represented. Accusations vary from Columbus being a racist, a rapist, a genocidal maniac, and even that he ran a child sex slave ring. The question is, are these allegations true? And, where are the scholars correcting Columbus? record? Unfortunately, some of the misinformation out there comes from ?scholars;? and even those who defend Columbus, won&#8217;t address the actual story either. In this book, the reader will learn who modern history revisionists claim Columbus was, and what he did, vs. the actual historical accounts, coming from the mouths of those who knew him well, and wrote about them for us. The conclusion will be inevitable, that is, Columbus was a Hero, and his story and legacy need to be rediscovered again today. This version is the Revised and </p>

Not all of them choose to see it that way.Everyday racism has never held them back, but now in their thirties, they question their future. Ronke wants a husband (he must be Nigerian); Boo enjoys (correction: endures) stay-at-home motherhood; while Simi, full of fashion career dreams, rolls her eyes as her boss refers to her urban vibe yet again.When Isobel, a lethally glamorous friend from their past arrives in town, she is determined to fix their futures for them.Cracks in their friendship begin to appear, and it is soon obvious Isobel is not sorting but wrecking. When she is driven to a terrible act, the women are forced to reckon with a crime in their past that may just have repeated itself.Explosive, hilarious and wildly entertaining, this razor-sharp tale of love, race and family will have you laughing, crying and gasping in horror.

<p>Summary : While her parents weren?t home, Sarvenaz Singh did something unforgivable?she got on a plane and flew five thousand miles away?and left behind the remnants of her bitter past.Now twenty-four, the childhood bedroom and eleven p.m. curfew enforced by her strict Indian parents were not cutting it. After a devastating year, she had broken the shackles and landed a shiny new Software Engineer job in the Big Apple. However, her handsome yet maddening new neighbour, Jordan Evans, and not as advertised job has her regretting the impulsive move. With limited options and her savings dwindling in the rat-infested New York sewer, she?s one wrong move away from having to take the next flight back home.The devil himself, Jordan Evans, seems to be finding her predicament quite amusing. Soon enough, they are left irritated when the proximity they?ve been trying so hard to avoid has cornered them both.Returning home as a failure meant endless lectures and stepping back into the ashes of her past. </p>

<p>Summary : This insightful and original book explores the key issues that countries in Africa and South Asia need to address in order to escape poverty. Challenging traditional assumptions about the world?s poorest countries, the top priorities to address are identified as adult literacy, electricity for manufacturing, and the consequence of the relationship between fertility and savings.These suggestions are placed within a historical perspective, placing discussions on modern day Africa and South Asia alongside the development of East Asia, Europe, and the Americas in previous generations and centuries.The Time-Travelling Economist aims to move conversations about development beyond the resource curse or private sector failings, with a fresh focus on the policies that governments can embark on independently and affordably that will transform their future. It will be of interest to anyone interested in the future of the world?s low income countries.</p>

Complex conversations around race, class, and gender that have been happening behind the closed doors of academia for decades are now becoming part of the wider cultural vernacular?one pithy tweet at a time.

<p>Summary : An updated edition of Andrew Morton&#8217;s New York Times?bestselling biography of Diana?When Andrew Morton&#8217;s Diana:?Her True Story was first published, it caused a media frenzy, severely jolted the royal family and the palace?hierarchy, and shook the British establishment to its foundations. Later revealed as having been written with the Princess&#8217;s full cooperation, this book is now widely regarded as her official biography. Yet it was not the full story, nor could it have been, given the circumstances at the time. This is even more apparent in the light of the events that have occurred since her death, which have been played out under the harsh gaze of?the media, once again catapulting Diana&#8217;s name back into the spotlight. Figures such as her sometime lover James Hewitt, her butler Paul Burrell, and Prince Charles&#8217;s valet, Michael Fawcett, have emerged, while intriguing comments that Diana made to Morton in taped conversation have become extremely important in view of subsequent events. </p>

<p>Summary : The Land Is Ours tells the story of South Africa?s first black lawyers, who operated in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In an age of aggressive colonial expansion, land dispossession and forced labour, these men believed in a constitutional system that respected individual rights and freedoms, and they used the law as an instrument against injustice. The book follows the lives, ideas and careers of Henry Sylvester Williams, Alfred Mangena, Richard Msimang, Pixley ka Isaka Seme, Ngcubu Poswayo and George Montsioa, who were all members of the ANC. It analyses the legal cases they took on, explores how they reconciled the law with the political upheavals of the day, and considers how they sustained their fidelity to the law when legal victories were undermined by politics. The Land Is Ours shows that these lawyers developed the concept of a Bill of Rights, which is now an international norm. The book is particularly relevant in light of current calls to scrap the </p>

<p>Summary : ?In this book, we travel back in time and across the globe, to see how we humans have shaped our world and been shaped by it over the past two million years. The story is told exclusively through the things that humans have made?all sorts of things, carefully designed and then either admired and preserved or used, broken and thrown away. I?ve chosen just a hundred objects from different points on our journey?from a cooking pot to a golden galleon, from a Stone Age tool to a credit card, and each object comes from the collection of the British Museum.? [From the introduction.]This book takes a dramatically original approach to the history of humanity, using objects which previous civilisations have left behind them, often accidentally, as prisms through which we can explore past worlds and the lives of the men and women who lived in them.

<p>Summary : Allie Hayes is in crisis mode. With graduation looming, she still doesn?t have the first clue about what she?s going to do after college. To make matters worse, she?s nursing a broken heart thanks to the end of her longtime relationship.Wild rebound sex is definitely not the solution to her problems, but gorgeous hockey star Dean Di Laurentis is impossible to resist. Just once, though, because even if her future is uncertain, it sure as heck won?t include the king of one-night stands.Dean always gets what he wants. Girls, grades, girls, recognition, girls ?he?s a ladies man, all right, and he?s yet to meet a woman who?s immune to his charms. Until Allie. For one night, the feisty blonde rocked his entire world?and now she wants to be friends? Nope. It?s not over until he says it?s over.Dean is in full-on pursuit, but when life-rocking changes strike, he starts to wonder if maybe it?s time to stop focusing on scoring? and shoot for love.</p>

<p>Summary : J.R.R. Tolkien?s writings on the Second Age of Middle-earth, collected for the first time in one volume.J.R.R. Tolkien famously described the Second Age of Middle-earth as a ?dark age, and not very much of its history is (or need be) told?. And for many years readers would need to be content with the tantalizing glimpses of it found within the pages of The Lord of the Rings and its appendices, including the forging of the Rings of Power, the building of the Barad-d?r and the rise of Sauron.It was not until Christopher Tolkien published The Silmarillion after his father?s death that a fuller story could be told. Although much of the book?s content concerned the First Age of Middle-earth, there were at its close two key works that revealed the tumultuous events concerning the rise and fall of the island of N?menor. Raised out of the Great Sea and gifted to the Men of Middle-earth as a reward for aiding the angelic Valar and the Elves in the defeat and capture of the Dark Lord Morgoth, </p>

<p>Summary : J.R.R. Tolkien?s writings on the Second Age of Middle-earth, collected for the first time in one volume.J.R.R. Tolkien famously described the Second Age of Middle-earth as a ?dark age, and not very much of its history is (or need be) told?. And for many years readers would need to be content with the tantalizing glimpses of it found within the pages of The Lord of the Rings and its appendices, including the forging of the Rings of Power, the building of the Barad-d?r and the rise of Sauron.It was not until Christopher Tolkien published The Silmarillion after his father?s death that a fuller story could be told. Although much of the book?s content concerned the First Age of Middle-earth, there were at its close two key works that revealed the tumultuous events concerning the rise and fall of the island of N?menor. Raised out of the Great Sea and gifted to the Men of Middle-earth as a reward for aiding the angelic Valar and the Elves in the defeat and capture of the Dark Lord Morgoth, </p>

<p>Summary : Most manuals on bookbinding tend to provide an outline of the basic bookbinding techniques, but do little to provide detailed information on specific aspects of the craft. A topic often overlooked is how to create endbands (also called &#8220;headbands&#8221;), those structural and decorative bands made of plain linen or hemp, silk or cotton thread, that one can see at the head and tail of the spine of a book. This manual, written by two experienced book conservators, is an easy to use, step-by-step guide showing how to create fourteen different types of historical endbands. Separate chapters are devoted to each, with all the necessary materials listed at the beginning. Among the examples are Coptic, Ethiopian, Islamic, Greek, Armenian, French, Monastic, Renaissance, Italian, German, and modern styles. Each step is clearly illustrated and all the instructions have been tried out on students of the craft and perfected at the bench, so that the easiest and simplest method is presented.

<p>Summary : Most manuals on bookbinding tend to provide an outline of the basic bookbinding techniques, but do little to provide detailed information on specific aspects of the craft. A topic often overlooked is how to create endbands (also called &#8220;headbands&#8221;), those structural and decorative bands made of plain linen or hemp, silk or cotton thread, that one can see at the head and tail of the spine of a book. This manual, written by two experienced book conservators, is an easy to use, step-by-step guide showing how to create fourteen different types of historical endbands. Separate chapters are devoted to each, with all the necessary materials listed at the beginning. Among the examples are Coptic, Ethiopian, Islamic, Greek, Armenian, French, Monastic, Renaissance, Italian, German, and modern styles. Each step is clearly illustrated and all the instructions have been tried out on students of the craft and perfected at the bench, so that the easiest and simplest method is presented.

<p>Summary : In the icy, monster-plagued world of the Frost, one wrong move and a person could end up dead?and Lia Weaver knows this better than anyone. After monsters kill her parents, she must keep the family farm running despite the freezing cold and threat of monster attacks or risk losing her siblings to reassignment by the village Elders. With dangers on all sides and failure just one wrong step away, she can?t afford to let her emotions lead her astray. So when her sister finds a fugitive bleeding to death in the forest?a young stranger named Gabe?Lia surprises herself and does the unthinkable.She saves his life.Giving shelter to the fugitive could get her in trouble. The Elders have always described the advanced society of people beyond the Frost, the ?Farthers,? as ruthless and cruel. But Lia is startled to find that Gabe is empathetic and intelligent?and handsome. She might even be falling in love with him.But time is running out. The monsters from the forest circle the farm at night. </p>

<p>Summary : Danny Kingman is used to fending for himself. Working nonstop as an ER nurse to pay for his mother?s care, he?s been putting his own life on hold since he can remember. But when an unbelievably hot, strangely intense man saves him from a mugging, Danny has a feeling everything is about to change. Especially when that man suddenly pops out a pair of fangs.Roman Mourier has been wandering aimlessly for decades, waiting for the inevitable day when the last of his humanity leaves him, and the demon inside him takes permanent control. He doesn?t believe in fated mates, or the myth that there?s a soul out there that could tether his humanity to him. Until he feels a strange pull to the lovely young man at the hospital, and hope stirs in him for the first time.But Roman has demons other than just the one inside him. Is he strong enough to keep Danny safe from the past that haunts him? He knows one thing for sure: now that he?s found his mate, he will do anything to keep him.</p>

<p>Summary : Danny Kingman is used to fending for himself. Working nonstop as an ER nurse to pay for his mother?s care, he?s been putting his own life on hold since he can remember. But when an unbelievably hot, strangely intense man saves him from a mugging, Danny has a feeling everything is about to change. Especially when that man suddenly pops out a pair of fangs.Roman Mourier has been wandering aimlessly for decades, waiting for the inevitable day when the last of his humanity leaves him, and the demon inside him takes permanent control. He doesn?t believe in fated mates, or the myth that there?s a soul out there that could tether his humanity to him. Until he feels a strange pull to the lovely young man at the hospital, and hope stirs in him for the first time.But Roman has demons other than just the one inside him. Is he strong enough to keep Danny safe from the past that haunts him? He knows one thing for sure: now that he?s found his mate, he will do anything to keep him.</p>

<p>Summary : This program is read by the author.Time is our biggest worry: There is too little of it. The acclaimed Guardian writer Oliver Burkeman offers a lively, entertaining philosophical guide to time and time management, setting aside superficial efficiency solutions in favor of reckoning with and finding joy in the finitude of human life.The average human lifespan is absurdly, insultingly brief. Assuming you live to be eighty, you have just over four thousand weeks.Nobody needs telling there isn?t enough time. We?re obsessed with our lengthening to-do lists, our overfilled inboxes, work-life balance, and the ceaseless battle against distraction; and we?re deluged with advice on becoming more productive and efficient, and ?life hacks? to optimize our days. But such techniques often end up making things worse. The sense of anxious hurry grows more intense, and still the most meaningful parts of life seem to lie just beyond the horizon. Still, we rarely make the connection between our daily </p>

<p>Summary : A Short History of European Law brings to life 2,500 years of legal history, tying current norms to the circumstances of their conception. Tamar Herzog describes how successive legal systems built upon one another, from ancient times through to the European Union. Roman law formed the backbone of each configuration, though the way it was used and reshaped varied dramatically from one century and place to the next. Only by considering Continental civil law and English common law together do we see how they drew from and enriched this shared tradition.&#8221;A remarkable achievement, sure to become a go-to text for scholars and students alike. Comprehensive and concise, it bridges the Continental and Anglo-American traditions and focuses on vital questions of legal authority and legitimacy. It is a must-read for anyone eager to understand the origins of core legal concepts and institutions.&#8221;&#8211;Amalia D.

<p>Summary : Passion, redemption, and a battered suitcase full of secrets: the New York Times-bestselling author of A Hundred Summers returns with another engrossing tale.Manhattan, 1964. Vivian Schuyler, newly graduated from Bryn Mawr College, has recently defied the privilege of her storied old Fifth Avenue family to do the unthinkable for a budding Kennedy-era socialite: break into the Mad Men world of razor-stylish Metropolitan magazine. But when she receives a bulky overseas parcel in the mail, the unexpected contents draw her inexorably back into her family?s past, and the hushed-over crime passionnel of an aunt she never knew, whose existence has been wiped from the record of history.Berlin, 1914. Violet Schuyler Grant endures her marriage to the philandering and decades-older scientist Dr. Walter Grant for one reason: for all his faults, he provides the necessary support to her liminal position as a young American female physicist in prewar Germany. The arrival of Dr. Grant?s magnetic </p>

<p>Summary : From the mega-bestselling creator of Heartstopper, a must-have novella in which Heartstopper&#8217;s lead characters, Nick and Charlie, face one of their biggest challenges yet.Absence makes the heart grow fonder&#8230; right? Everyone knows that Nick and Charlie love their nearly inseparable life together. But soon Nick will be leaving for university, and Charlie, a year younger, will be left behind. Everyone&#8217;s asking if they&#8217;re staying together, which is a stupid question&#8230; or at least that&#8217;s what Nick and Charlie assume at first.As the time to say goodbye gets inevitably closer, both Nick and Charlie start to question whether their love is strong enough to survive being apart. Charlie is sure he&#8217;s holding Nick back&#8230; and Nick can&#8217;t tell what Charlie&#8217;s thinking.Things spiral from there.Everyone knows that first loves rarely last forever. What will it take for Nick and Charlie to defy the odds?</p>

One day, while tidying Lady Dant?s wardrobe, she comes across the most beautiful thing she has ever seen in her life?a Dior dress. In all the years of her drab and humble existence, she?s never seen anything as magical as the dress before her and she?s never wanted anything so badly.

Always kind, always cheery, and always winsome, the indomitable </p>

<p>Summary : Spider  She?s mine. Not because she?s in love with me,  but because as the Sergeant At Arms for the Devil?s Outlaws MC,  I?m expected to handle her.   I enjoy punishing her for her crime against the MC.  I?m glad she did what she did.  Because now I get to keep her.   But she?s not who she says she is.  I?m going to get to the bottom of her little game and shut it down.   Now I can?t figure out if I need to kill her or protect her.  I?ll keep her alive?as long as she doesn?t lie.   Emma  What did I do? One bad decision sent my world spiraling into hell.  Straight into the arms of a monster.  I had no choice.  Now the question is  which is better,  The cult whose horrors I barely escaped,  Or the nightmare my outlaw captor has trapped me in?   I may hate where I am now,  But I can?t stop thinking about him.  I loathe him with every fiber of my being,  yet when he leaves, I crave his touch.   I?m his captive, his prisoner.  I?m playing a role,  Planning my escape.  As long as he </p>

<p>Summary : The long-awaited memoir, generously illustrated with never-before-seen photos, from the iconic Rock and Roll Hall of Famer, Rush bassist, and bestselling author of Geddy Lee&#8217;s Big Beautiful Book of Bass.Geddy Lee is one of rock and roll&#8217;s most respected bassists. For nearly five decades, his playing and work as co-writer, vocalist and keyboardist has been an essential part of the success story of Canadian progressive rock trio Rush. Here for the first time is his account of life inside and outside the band.Long before Rush accumulated more consecutive gold and platinum records than any rock band after the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, before the seven Grammy nominations or the countless electrifying live performances across the globe, Geddy Lee was Gershon Eliezer Weinrib, after his grandfather murdered in the Holocaust.As he recounts the transformation, Lee looks back on his family, in particular his loving parents and their horrific experiences as teenagers during World War II.He </p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  A witty, informative guide to writing &#8220;good English&#8221; from Random House&#8217;s longtime copy chief and one of Twitter&#8217;s leading enforcers of proper grammar&#8211;a twenty-first-century </p>
<p>    Elements of Style</p>
<p>As authoritative as it is amusing, this book distills everything Benjamin Dreyer has learned from the hundreds of books he has copyedited, including works by Elizabeth Strout, E. L. Doctorow, and Frank Rich, into a useful guide not just for writers but for everyone who wants to put their best foot forward in writing prose. Dreyer offers lessons on the ins and outs of punctuation and grammar, including how to navigate the words he calls &#8220;the confusables,&#8221; like tricky homophones; the myriad ways to use (and misuse) a comma; and how to recognize&#8211;though not necessarily do away with&#8211;the passive voice. (Hint: If you can plausibly add &#8220;by zombies&#8221; to the end of a sentence, it&#8217;s passive.) People are sharing their writing more than ever&#8211;on blogs, on Twitter&#8211;and this book lays out, </p>

<p>Summary : A can?t-miss read for fans of Deborah Harkness and Karen Marie Moning, The Angel Stone weaves a tale of ancient folklore and thrilling fantasy with a passionate love story that transcends time.   For Callie McFay, a half-witch/half-fey professor of folklore and Gothic literature, the fight to save the enchanted town of Fairwick, New York, is far from over. After a hostile takeover by the Grove?a sinister group of witches and their cohorts?many of the local fey have been banished or killed, including Callie?s one true love. And in place of the spirit of tolerance and harmony, the new administration at Fairwick College has fostered an air of danger and distrust.   With her unique magical abilities, Callie is the only one who can rescue her friends from exile and restore order to the school?a task that requires her to find the Angel Stone, a legendary talisman of immense power. Propelled on an extraordinary quest back to seventeenth-century Scotland, Callie risks her life to obtain the </p>

<p>Summary : Financed by fans, this huge graphic novel is the coming-of-age story of a teenage girl. Set in a unique and original world filled with both angels and robots, her story is a page-turning techno-epic that recounts the clash between self-conscious robots and a million different species of angels. While pure cinematic fantasy, the story anticipates the real issue of whether machines can have souls and will wow graphic novel fans in search of new heroes and new worlds. This spectacular, oversized, lusciously printed 464-page graphic novel combines the two worlds of high-technology and deep spirituality. The book was financed by the robust fans of a successful Kickstarter campaign.</p>
