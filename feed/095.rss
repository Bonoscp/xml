<p>Summary : This version is currently not available.When everything happens Out of the Blue?Lt Cameron Cooper has been with the San Francisco Fire Department for fifteen years. He?s seen and dealt with a lot of horrifying situations. He?s always considered himself mentally tough, but when he attends a multi-vehicle accident and sees a dead boy with features remarkably similar to his long-time boyfriend, his mental health takes a hit.All Jake Montgomery wants is to propose to his boyfriend on their ten-year anniversary. He?s already bought the perfect rings, but when Cameron struggles to look at him after a tragic accident, he has doubts about their future. Cam is withdrawing, and Jake doesn?t know why.With heated arguments and cold shoulders, Cam and Jake?s life starts to fall apart. Just when Cam thinks he can overcome his issues and finally talk to Jake, memories from Jake?s past threaten to push them apart forever.</p>

<p>Summary : They&#8217;re about to embark on their greatest adventure yet.Joey Moore got her heart stomped on. At her engagement party. So, she did what any normal, completely rational 28-year-old would do ? she moved to a new city with her dog to start a new life. Without much of a plan, it turns out.Kendall O?Hara doesn?t enjoy chaos ? at 42-years-old, she has a stable job and a cat she likes more than most people. Okay, all people. She likes routine (and yelling the correct Jeopardy answers right before the contestants do). She?s not boring. She?s just protecting a her still-healing heart decades later.When Joey and Kendall?s paths cross, a rocky start with an accidental laundry switch turns into an unlikely friendship. From there, the two friends make a pact to get out of their comfort zones, one piece of paper drawn from an ?Adventure Jar? at a time. A growing mutual attraction leads them on an adventure that neither one might have expected?</p>

<p>Summary : Identify, understand, and reframe your life story with this essential guide for self-acceptance from Lisa Olivera, a therapist, writer, and creator of a wildly popular Instagram account.When Lisa Olivera was just a few hours old, her birth mother abandoned her behind a rock near Muir Woods in Northern California. She was found and later adopted. Growing up, Lisa knew she was adopted and later learned she was abandoned. Like with many adopted children, this led to questions. Including this big one: why did her mother leave her behind? Without answers, Lisa came up with her own: something must be wrong with her. Lisa came to believe she was not enough. This story wasn?t true, but it made sense of a confusing experience. It allowed her to move forward. It felt like the only way. Until, with the help of a therapist, Lisa began to tell herself a better story. And now, a therapist herself, she shows you how you can too. In Already Enough, Lisa gets honest about our stories and how they </p>

<p>Summary : The endgame is at hand for Penn Cage, his family, and the enemies bent on destroying them in this revelatory volume in the epic trilogy set in modern-day Natchez, Mississippi?Greg Iles?s epic tale of love and honor, hatred and revenge that explores how the sins of the past continue to haunt the present.Shattered by grief and dreaming of vengeance, Penn Cage sees his family and his world collapsing around him. The woman he loves is gone, his principles have been irrevocably compromised, and his father, once a paragon of the community that Penn leads as mayor, is about to be tried for the murder of a former lover.

<p>Summary : The Ismailis are the second-largest Shi&#8217;i community in the world today, settled in over 25 countries across Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Europe and North America. They are the only Muslims to follow a living spiritual guide of their community, the Nizari Ismaili Imam. This book is the first collection of biographies of all the Ismaili Imams, from the seminal Imams of early Shi&#8217;i Islam, through to those of the first &#8216;period of concealment&#8217; when their public identities remained hidden, to the Imam-caliphs of the illustrious Fatimid dynasty, and those of the Alamut period, up to the Aga Khans of the modern period. The Ismaili Imams mines the rich scholarship of the developing field of Ismaili Studies, providing a simple and clear resource for the general reader, as well as a handy reference guide for scholars. This copiously illustrated book offers a snapshot of the lives, events, and legacies of all 49 Imams, and through them, of the Ismaili community&#8217;s storied past.</p>

<p>Summary : Hidden in Plain View: Undesigned Coincidences in the Gospels and Acts revives an argument for the historical reliability of the New Testament that has been largely neglected for more than a hundred years. An undesigned coincidence is an apparently casual, yet puzzle-like -fit- between two or more texts, and its best explanation is that the authors knew the truth about the events they describe or allude to. Connections of this kind among passages in the Gospels, as well as between Acts and the Pauline epistles, give us reason to believe that these documents came from honest eyewitness sources, people -in the know- about the events they relate. Supported by careful research yet accessibly written, Hidden in Plain View provides solid evidence that all Christians can use to defend the Scriptures and the truth of Christianity.</p>

<p>Summary : Zana Muhsen, born and bred in Birmingham, is of Yemeni origin. When her father told her she was to spend a holiday with relatives in North Yemen, she jumped at the chance. Aged 15 and 13 respectively, Zana and her sister discovered that they had been literally sold into marriage, and that on their arrival they were virtually prisoners. They had to adapt to a completely alien way of life, with no running water, dung-plastered walls, frequent beatings, and the ordeal of childbirth on bare floors with only old women in attendance. After eight years of misery and humiliation Zana succeeded in escaping, but her sister is still there, and it seems likely that she will now never leave the country where she has spent more than half her life. This is an updated edition of Zana&#8217;s account of her experiences.</p>

<p>Summary : I&#8217;m on dry land, but I&#8217;ve never been more at sea.What if you discovered the vacation fling you fell madly in love with is the boss of a sophisticated crime syndicate?I thought these things only happen in romance novels. My fairytale fortnight turns into a nightmare when I wake up, drugged and kidnapped with a monster headache.Where the heck am I? And who would abduct me? Will Tiero come to my rescue?I find myself risking lives to save my own. Yet amongst the extreme danger and strained relationships are new friends and moments of ecstasy. Tiero?s world isn?t for me. But for my heart, there is no going back. No matter what I do, there?s a target on my back. Will I come out of this alive? And what will it cost me?Nights At Sea is book 2 of the Triple Flame Trilogy and requires having read book 1 Sicilian Sunset. This book will end on a cliffhanger.</p>

After reading his book, you won&#8217;t wonder anymore &#8211; you&#8217;ll know why it is happening and what can be done about it.Beyond Democracy is a groundbreaking and fascinating book for everyone who wants to better understand current social problems and the economic crisis.

<p>Summary : ?Welcome to the escape room. Your goal is simple. Get out alive.? In the lucrative world of Wall Street finance, Vincent, Jules, Sylvie and Sam are the ultimate high-flyers. Ruthlessly ambitious, they make billion-dollar deals and live lives of outrageous luxury. Getting rich is all that matters, and they&#8217;ll do anything to get ahead.When the four of them become trapped in an elevator escape room, things start to go horribly wrong. They have to put aside their fierce office rivalries and work together to solve the clues that will release them. But in the confines of the elevator the dark secrets of their team are laid bare. They are made to answer for profiting from a workplace where deception, intimidation and sexual harassment thrive.Tempers fray and the escape room?s clues turn more and more ominous, leaving the four of them dangling on the precipice of disaster. If they want to survive, they?ll have to solve one final puzzle: which one of them is a killer?</p>

<p>Summary : The great goddesses of Egypt inspired magnificent temples and art and a literature that speaks of their supreme importance to the ancients&#8211;men and women, royalty and commoners. In this book Barbara S. Lesko follows the changing fortunes, over thousands of years, of the seven most significant Egyptian Nut, Neith, Nekhbet, Wadjet, Hathor, Mut, and Isis. Some appeared in prehistory, and some were later political creations. One became a universally revered goddess of the Greco-Roman world who successfully held her own against Christianity for five hundred years. Although they often assumed human form, some goddesses were associated with animals that Lesko traces back to African clan divinities. Understood as the sun?s heat, the Milky Way, the flood, and the mother of the king of Egypt, the great goddesses also assumed the caring role of protector for deserving humans, assisting with careers, romance, and fertility. They held out the promise of eternal life, and records show that they </p>

<p>Summary : Product DescriptionThis unique portrait of Mark Rothko captures his astonishing use of color as it illustrates the story of his life, career, struggles, and philosophy. Mark Rothko&#8217;s work is among the most recognizable in modern art history. His huge color-field works enjoy enormous popularity for their luminosity, moodiness, and immersive qualities. But he didn&#8217;t always paint in bold, simple swaths of color. This graphic biography traces Rothko&#8217;s entire life, from his boyhood emigration from Russia to America, to his suicide in 1970. It touches on his schooling and early work for the WPA in the 1930s; the evolution of his art from representational to purely abstract; and the dawning of his artistic philosophy, which took him farther and farther away from the material world and toward a universally emotional and expressionist modality. The book&#8217;s finely detailed drawings are Rothko&#8217;s signature colors and draw readers into his fascinating creative journey. While Rothko the artist was </p>

<p>Summary : Explore the long and rich history of China&#8217;s great dynasties.From the clans and legends of prehistory to the last Qing emperor, this book brings China&#8217;s imperial history to life through its pivotal events, political forces, and powerful people, in a stunning collaboration between British and Chinese publishing houses.Covering more than 5,000 years of history and featuring images of artefacts not previously seen outside of China, this definitive visual guide will captivate readers with the key events that shaped Chinese history and laid the foundations of the modern nation.

<p>Summary : Audrey is over romance. While dealing with her parents? contentious divorce, a breakup of her own, and shifting friendship dynamics, she has every reason to feel cynical. But then she meets Harry, her fellow coworker at the local cinema. He?s brash, impulsive, and a major flirt. And even though Audrey tries to resist, she finds herself falling for his charms. But in this funny, insightful, and ultimately empowering novel, love?and life?isn?t what it?s like in the movies.A clever, deconstructed rom-com that proves that in real life ?girl meets boy? doesn&#8217;t always mean ?happily ever after? . . . or does it? At turns funny, feminist, and achingly real, this read is perfect for fans of Sophie Kinsella, Patrick Ness, and Julie Buxbaum.</p>

Should Amanda and Clay trust this couple &#8211; and vice versa? What has happened back in New York? Is the holiday home, isolated from civilisation, a truly safe place for their families? And are they safe from one another?</p>

<p>Summary : Built using the hands-on and pioneering Missouri Method, this textbook prepares readers to write about and communicate with people of different backgrounds, offering real-world examples of how to practice excellent journalism and strategic communication that takes culture into account. No matter the communication purpose, this book will help readers engage with difference and the concept of fault lines, and to identify and mitigate bias. It provides guidance on communicating the complexity inherent in issues like crime, immigration, and sports, and working with census data to craft stories or strategic campaigns. Above all, the book encourages readers to reconsider assumptions about race, class, gender, identity, sexual orientation, immigration status, religion, disability, and age, and recognize communicators&#8217; responsibilities in shaping national discussions. This new edition addresses the ever-changing political and social climate, differentiates excellent journalism from punditry, </p>

<p>Summary : Faber Stories, a landmark series of individual volumes, presents masters of the short story form at work in a range of genres and styles.When Ray turns up to visit his old university friends Charlie and Emily, he&#8217;s given a special task: to be so much his useless self that he makes Charlie look good by comparison.But Ray has his own buried feelings to contend with. Decades earlier, he and Emily would listen to jazz when they were alone, and now, as Sarah Vaughan sings through the speakers, he struggles to control everything the sound brings with it.In Kazuo Ishiguro&#8217;s hands, a snapshot of domestic realism becomes a miniature masterpiece of memory and forgetting.Bringing together past, present and future in our ninetieth year, Faber Stories is a celebratory compendium of collectable work.</p>

<p>Summary : In 1906 George Shiras III (1859-1942) published a series of remarkable nighttime photographs in National Geographic. Taken with crude equipment, the black-and-white photographs featured leaping whitetail deer, a beaver gnawing on a tree, and a snowy owl perched along the shore of a lake in Michigan&#8217;s Upper Peninsula. The pictures, stunning in detail and composition, celebrated American wildlife at a time when many species were going extinct because of habitat loss and unrestrained hunting. As a congressman and lawyer, Shiras joined forces with his friend Theodore Roosevelt and scientists in Washington, DC, who shaped the conservation movement during the Progressive Era. His legal and legislative efforts culminated with the passage of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.Camera Hunter recounts Shiras&#8217;s life and craft as he traveled to wild country in North America, refined his trail camera techniques, and advocated for the protection of wildlife. This biography serves as an important record </p>

<p>Summary : Bestselling Author Shows How to Access the Power of the Holy Spirit The majority of Christians understand grace as not getting the judgment they deserve and receiving the eternal life they don&#8217;t deserve. But the greatness of God&#8217;s grace and his salvation are far more than what most of us have come to expect Here Randy Clark shares what that &#8220;more&#8221; is&#8211;more love for God and others, more power, more joy, more faith, more results in prayer&#8211;and how believers can experience God&#8217;s empowering presence in their lives to do more than they ever imagined. &#8220;More&#8221; is not only biblical, explains Clark, but essential for greater fruitfulness in ministry and for serving in the kingdom of God with joy and effectiveness.</p>

<p>Summary : Before she became a celebrated teacher and lecturer, Gabrielle Bernstein was going down a dangerous path. For years, Bernstein struggled with eating disorders, drug and alcohol abuse, and constant self-doubt and self-loathing. That all changed when she discovered A Course in Miracles, which taught her that much of what she feared in life was not frightening at all and, in many cases, not even real.Now, Bernstein lives an empowered, healthy, and joyful life. In Spirit Junkie, Bernstein guides readers through the life-changing lessons that shaped her spiritual journey: how we become accustomed to fearful ways of thinking, how to recognize and change those thought patterns to make way for bliss, and how to maintain our happiness and share it with the world. By understanding and changing our perceptions, hang-ups will melt away, resentments will release, and a childlike faith in joy will be reignited.</p>

So what could go wrong?Mackenzie ?Mac? Cabot is a people pleaser. Her demanding parents. Her prep school friends. Her long-time boyfriend. It?s exhausting, really, always following the rules. Unlike most twenty-year-olds, all she really wants to do is focus on growing her internet business, but first she must get a college degree at her parents? insistence.

Cooper is rough around the edges. Raw. Candid. A threat to her ordered existence. Their friendship soon becomes the realest thing in her life.Despite his disdain for the trust-fund kids he sees coming and going </p>

<p>Summary : In the thrilling, nerve-wracking finale of Ezekiel Boone?s ?hair-raising? (Parade) Hatching series, the United States goes to war against the queen spiders that threaten to overtake the human race forever.The world is on the brink of apocalypse. Zero Day has come.The only thing more terrifying than millions of spiders is the realization that those spiders work as one. But among the government, there is dissent: do we try to kill all of the spiders, or do we gamble on Professor Guyer?s theory that we need to kill only the queens?For President Stephanie Pilgrim, it?s an easy answer. She?s gone as far as she can?more than two dozen American cities hit with tactical nukes, the country torn asunder?and the only answer is to believe in Professor Guyer. Unfortunately, Ben Broussard and the military men who follow him don?t agree, and Pilgrim, Guyer, and the loyal members of the government have to flee, leaving the question: what?s more dangerous, the spiders or ourselves?</p>

He has been there for eight years, living at the Rectory alongside his widowed mother &#8211; opinionated, fearless, ever-so-slightly annoying Audrey &#8211; and his two dachshunds, Cosmo and Hilda.When Daniel announces a plan to install a lavatory in church, the parish is suddenly (and unexpectedly) divided: as lines are drawn, long-buried secrets come dangerously close to destroying the apparent calm of the village.And then Anthony Bowness &#8211; cousin to Bernard de Floures, patron of Champton &#8211; is found dead at the back of the church, stabbed in the neck with a pair of secateurs.As the police moves in and the bodies start piling up, Daniel is the only one who can try and keep his fractured community together&#8230; and catch a killer.</p>

<p>Summary : Experience is the best teacher. Learn from someone who?s been there. In this book, I share my real world experiences and scenarios as a clinical pharmacist to help you get a better grasp on medication management. I?ve been acknowledged in the Wall Street Journal, American Journal of Nursing, National Association Directors of Nursing, Pharmacy Times, and Pharmacy Today. My goal is to teach you clinical common sense when it comes to medications. If you are a healthcare professional (pharmacist, nurse, primary provider etc.) involved in medication management, this is a book full of clinical pearls, case studies, and medication mistakes that every healthcare professional should know. If you?re passionate about learning more about polypharmacy, drug interactions, medication therapy management and common medication mistakes, you?re going to love this book.

<p>Summary : Here are thirty-two classic myths that bring the Viking world vividly to life. The mythic legacy of the Scandinavians includes a cycle of stories filled with magnificent images from pre-Christian Europe. Gods, humans, and monstrous beasts engage in prodigious drinking bouts, contests of strength, greedy schemes for gold, and lusty encounters. The Norse pantheon includes Odin, the wisest and most fearsome of the gods; Thor, the thundering powerhouse; and the exquisite, magic-wielding Freyja. Their loves, wars, and adventures take us through worlds both mortal and divine, culminating in a blazing doomsday for gods and humans alike. These stories bear witness to the courage, passion, and boundless spirit that were hallmarks of the Norse world.?Kevin Crossley-Holland retells the Norse myths in clear, attractive prose . . . An excellent introduction, notes, and a glossary provide mythological and historical backgrounds and suggest parallels with myths in other parts of the world.??The </p>

<p>Summary : Here are thirty-two classic myths that bring the Viking world vividly to life. The mythic legacy of the Scandinavians includes a cycle of stories filled with magnificent images from pre-Christian Europe. Gods, humans, and monstrous beasts engage in prodigious drinking bouts, contests of strength, greedy schemes for gold, and lusty encounters. The Norse pantheon includes Odin, the wisest and most fearsome of the gods; Thor, the thundering powerhouse; and the exquisite, magic-wielding Freyja. Their loves, wars, and adventures take us through worlds both mortal and divine, culminating in a blazing doomsday for gods and humans alike. These stories bear witness to the courage, passion, and boundless spirit that were hallmarks of the Norse world.?Kevin Crossley-Holland retells the Norse myths in clear, attractive prose . . . An excellent introduction, notes, and a glossary provide mythological and historical backgrounds and suggest parallels with myths in other parts of the world.??The </p>

<p>Summary : Margaret Jacobsen has a bright future ahead of her: a fianc? she adores, her dream job, and the promise of a picture-perfect life just around the corner. Then, suddenly, on what should have been one of the happiest days of her life, everything she worked for is taken away in one tumultuous moment. In the hospital and forced to face the possibility that nothing will ever be the same again, Margaret must figure out how to move forward on her own terms while facing long-held family secrets, devastating heartbreak, and the idea that love might find her in the last place she would ever expect.</p>

<p>Summary : Centered squarely on the Negro-white conflict, both Dutchman and The Slave are literally shocking plays?in ideas, in language, in honest anger. They illuminate as with a flash of lightning a deadly serious problem?and they bring an eloquent and exceptionally powerful voice to the American theatre.Dutchman opened in New York City on March 24, 1964, to perhaps the most excited acclaim ever accorded an off-Broadway production and shortly thereafter received the Village Voice&#8217;s Obie Award. The Slave, which was produced off-Broadway the following fall, continues to be the subject of heated critical controversy.</p>

<p>Summary : Business partnerships are vital to the US economy yet their failure rate is alarming: 70% of them don&#8217;t make it. Dr. Lehavi is leading the charge to reverse this statistic. As a business partnership relationship coach, she intimately knows the impact that these partnerships have on cofounders, employees, customers, families, local communities, and global markets. Business Partnership Essentials walks you through every phase of the process&#8211;from choosing the right partner and operating your business on a daily basis, all the way through to exit and planning for the unexpected. This book is not a book on business startups and so it does not address the finances of starting up a partnership, but rather, it focuses on agreeing on all aspects of your relationship with your business partner. Following Lehavi&#8217;s guidance will ensure that you&#8217;ve done everything you can to help your partnership succeed.</p>

<p>Summary : Tom Stoppard is a towering and beloved literary figure. Known for his dizzying narrative inventiveness and intense attention to language, he deftly deploys art, science, history, politics, and philosophy in works that span a remarkable spectrum of literary genres: theater, radio, film, TV, journalism, and fiction. His most acclaimed creations &#8211; &#8216;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead&#8217;, &#8216;The Real Thing&#8217;, &#8216;Arcadia&#8217;, &#8216;The Coast of Utopia&#8217;, &#8216;Shakespeare in Love&#8217;, &#8211; remain as fresh and moving as when they entranced their first audiences.Born in Czechoslovakia, Stoppard escaped the Nazis with his mother and spent his early years in Singapore and India before arriving in England at the age of eight. Skipping university, he embarked on a brilliant career, becoming close friends over the years with an astonishing array of writers, actors, directors, musicians, and political figures, from Peter O&#8217;Toole, Harold Pinter, and Stephen Spielberg to Mick Jagger and V?clav Havel.

<p>Summary : Forensic Psychology provides students with an in-depth and insightful introduction to the clinical practice of forensic psychology. Incorporating two main themes, scope of practice and therapeutic jurisprudence, the text focuses on empirically supported clinical practice and exposes students to case and statutory laws necessary in the practice of forensic psychology. The text utilizes real world examples that help students understand the practical applications of forensic psychology. It encourages an understanding of the law as a living and breathing entity, examining its ability to be therapeutic or anti-therapeutic to the people impacted by it.

<p>Summary : Illustrando il celebre compendio del folklore giapponese, Benjamin Lacombe offre un tributo al lavoro di Lafcadio Hearn. All?inizio del Novecento, lo scrittore irlandese fu uno dei primi occidentali a ottenere la cittadinanza giapponese: l?amore per la cultura della sua nuova patria lo port? a percorrere le varie province del Paese, al fine di trascrivere le storie di fantasmi e le leggende tramandate di generazione in generazione. In Storie di fantasmi del Giappone, Benjamin Lacombe sceglie lo stile adatto a ogni racconto, reinterpretando l?ampia gamma del bestiario tradizionale con la sua inimitabile arte. In appendice al volume, alcuni giochi ispirati a quelli tradizionali permettono d?inventare la propria leggenda di yokai. La presente edizione, a cura di Ottavio Fatica, riprende parte dei testi da lui tradotti per Adelphi nella raccolta Ombre giapponesi, completandola con altri, qui proposti per la prima volta al pubblico italiano.</p>

<p>Summary : Illustrando il celebre compendio del folklore giapponese, Benjamin Lacombe offre un tributo al lavoro di Lafcadio Hearn. All?inizio del Novecento, lo scrittore irlandese fu uno dei primi occidentali a ottenere la cittadinanza giapponese: l?amore per la cultura della sua nuova patria lo port? a percorrere le varie province del Paese, al fine di trascrivere le storie di fantasmi e le leggende tramandate di generazione in generazione. In Storie di fantasmi del Giappone, Benjamin Lacombe sceglie lo stile adatto a ogni racconto, reinterpretando l?ampia gamma del bestiario tradizionale con la sua inimitabile arte. In appendice al volume, alcuni giochi ispirati a quelli tradizionali permettono d?inventare la propria leggenda di yokai. La presente edizione, a cura di Ottavio Fatica, riprende parte dei testi da lui tradotti per Adelphi nella raccolta Ombre giapponesi, completandola con altri, qui proposti per la prima volta al pubblico italiano.</p>

<p>Summary : Someday I want to live in a place where I never hear ?You?re Dusty?s sister?? ever again.Life is real enough for Dylan?especially as the ordinary younger sister of Dusty, former Miss Mississippi and the most perfect, popular girl in Tupelo. But when Dusty wins the hand of the handsome Scottish laird-to-be Ronan on the TRC television network?s crown jewel, Prince in Disguise, Dylan has to face a different kind of reality: reality TV.As the camera crew whisks them off to Scotland to film the lead-up to the wedding, camera-shy Dylan is front and center as Dusty?s maid of honor. The producers are full of surprises?including old family secrets, long-lost relatives, and a hostile future mother-in-law who thinks Dusty and Dylan?s family isn?t good enough for her only son. At least there?s Jamie, an adorably bookish groomsman who might just be the perfect antidote to all Dylan?s stress . . . if she just can keep TRC from turning her into the next reality show sensation.</p>

<p>Summary : Someday I want to live in a place where I never hear ?You?re Dusty?s sister?? ever again.Life is real enough for Dylan?especially as the ordinary younger sister of Dusty, former Miss Mississippi and the most perfect, popular girl in Tupelo. But when Dusty wins the hand of the handsome Scottish laird-to-be Ronan on the TRC television network?s crown jewel, Prince in Disguise, Dylan has to face a different kind of reality: reality TV.As the camera crew whisks them off to Scotland to film the lead-up to the wedding, camera-shy Dylan is front and center as Dusty?s maid of honor. The producers are full of surprises?including old family secrets, long-lost relatives, and a hostile future mother-in-law who thinks Dusty and Dylan?s family isn?t good enough for her only son. At least there?s Jamie, an adorably bookish groomsman who might just be the perfect antidote to all Dylan?s stress . . . if she just can keep TRC from turning her into the next reality show sensation.</p>

<p>Summary : Recovered from a strong box on the Millennium Falcon, Star Wars: Smuggler&#8217;s Guide traces its own extraordinary journey through such notorious characters as Maz Kanata, Hondo Ohnaka, Drydon Vos, Lando Calrissian, and Han Solo. Explore previously unknown details about the underhanded dealings of the galaxy&#8217;s underworld. The lengths to which the underworld will go for a legendary prize is unparalleled. What started as a simple logbook with a piece of valuable information was soon stolen, traded, and smuggled around the outer rim and shady ports. With each pirate, thief, gambler, and criminal who took possession of the book, new insight and details were added, creating the Smuggler&#8217;s Guide&#8211;a coveted collection of hidden treasure locations, advice, and hard-earned data.</p>

<p>Summary : Mencintaimu bukanlah sesuatu yang kuharapkan terjadi.Aku tak ingin harapan datang lagi, berkunjung di hati, diam untuk beberapa waktu, lalu meninggalkanku dalam kesedihan berlipat-lipat. Aku tahu pasti ini kesalahan yang seharusnya tidak boleh terjadi. Tapi kau hanya memelukku, tanpa suara. Menggenggam tanganku erat seolah tak ingin melepasnya lagi. Dan sebelum aku berhasil menyangkal cintamu lagi, aku menyadari kau meninggalkan sesuatu di tanganku. Sesuatu yang kukenali sebagai&#8230; harapan. Dan, kali ini, aku ingin menggenggamnya, memilikinya sekalipun seandainya itu salah. *  BEAUTIFUL MISTAKE adalah GagasDuet, novella dari dua penulis kebanggaan GagasMedia, Prisca Primasari dan Sefryana Khairil. Keduanya masing-masing mempersembahkan cerita cinta tentang pentingnya sebuah kesempatan kedua bagi mimpi dan cita-cita. Biarkanlah cinta yang menunjukkan arah bagi hatimu. Sebelumnya, Prisca Primasari sudah pernah merilis Eclair: Pagi Terakhir di Rusia (2011), sedangkan karya-karya yang </p>

<p>Summary : One of the glorious Rutshire Chronicles.Into the cut-throat world of Corinium television comes Declan O?Hara, a mega-star of great glamour and integrity with a radiant feckless wife, a handsome son and two ravishing teenage daughters. Living rather too closely across the valley is Rupert Campbell-Black, divorced and as dissolute as ever, and now the Tory Minister for Sport.Declan needs only a few days at Corinium to realize that the Managing Director, Lord Baddingham, is a crook who has recruited him merely to help retain the franchise for Corinium. Baddingham has also enticed Cameron Cook, a gorgeous but domineering woman executive, to produce Declan?s programme. Declan and Cameron detest each other, provoking a storm of controversy into which Rupert plunges with his usual abandon.As a rival group emerges to pitch for the franchise, reputations ripen and decline, true love blossoms and burns, marriages are made and shattered, and sex raises its (delicious) head at almost every throw </p>

Living rather too closely across the valley is Rupert Campbell-Black, divorced and as dissolute as ever, and now the Tory Minister for Sport.Declan needs only a few days at Corinium to realize that the Managing Director, Lord Baddingham, is a crook who has recruited him merely to help retain the franchise for Corinium. Baddingham has also enticed Cameron Cook, a gorgeous but domineering woman executive, to produce Declan?s programme. Declan and Cameron detest each other, provoking a storm of controversy into which Rupert plunges with his usual abandon.As a rival group emerges to pitch for the franchise, reputations ripen and decline, true love blossoms and burns, marriages are made and shattered, and sex raises its (delicious) head at almost every throw Discover the Bestseller Everyone is Talking About: Read Rivals (Rutshire Chronicles #2) PDF , Reading Rivals (Rutshire Chronicles #2) pdf , Rivals (Rutshire Chronicles #2) Handbook , Rivals (Rutshire Chronicles #2) read , Rivals (Rutshire Chronicles #2) epub , Rivals (Rutshire Chronicles #2) in English , Rivals (Rutshire Chronicles #2) Kindle , Rivals (Rutshire Chronicles #2) audiobook Rivals (Rutshire Chronicles #2) Summary.

<p>Summary : Gilles Deleuze had several paintings by Francis Bacon hanging in his Paris apartment, and the painter?s method and style as well as his motifs of seriality, difference, and repetition influenced Deleuze?s work. This first English translation shows us one of the most original and important French philosophers of the twentieth century in intimate confrontation with one of that century?s most original and important painters. In considering Bacon, Deleuze offers implicit and explicit insights into the origins and development of his own philosophical and aesthetic ideas, ideas that represent a turning point in his intellectual trajectory.First published in French in 1981, Francis Bacon has come to be recognized as one of Deleuze?s most significant texts in aesthetics. Anticipating his work on cinema, the baroque, and literary criticism, the book can be read not only as a study of Bacon?s paintings but also as a crucial text within Deleuze?s broader philosophy of art. In it, Deleuze </p>

<p>Summary : Margaret Atwood&#8217;s The Robber Bride is inspired by &#8220;The Robber Bridegroom,&#8221; a wonderfully grisly tale from the Brothers Grimm in which an evil groom lures three maidens into his lair and devours them, one by one. But in her version, Atwood brilliantly recasts the monster as Zenia, a villainess of demonic proportions, and sets her loose in the lives of three friends, Tony,Charis, and Roz. All three &#8220;have lost men, spirit, money, and time to their old college acquaintance, Zenia. At various times, and in various emotional disguises, Zenia has insinuated her way into their lives and practically demolished them. To Tony, who almost lost her husband and jeopardized her academic career, Zenia is &#8216;a lurking enemy??commando.&#8217; To Roz, who did lose her husband and almost her magazine, Zenia is &#8216;a cold and treacherous bitch.&#8217; To Charis, who lost a boyfriend, quarts of vegetable juice and some pet chickens, Zenia is a kind of zombie, maybe &#8216;soulless'&#8221; (Lorrie Moore, New York Times Book??Review). </p>

<p>Summary : Margaret Atwood&#8217;s The Robber Bride is inspired by &#8220;The Robber Bridegroom,&#8221; a wonderfully grisly tale from the Brothers Grimm in which an evil groom lures three maidens into his lair and devours them, one by one. But in her version, Atwood brilliantly recasts the monster as Zenia, a villainess of demonic proportions, and sets her loose in the lives of three friends, Tony,Charis, and Roz. All three &#8220;have lost men, spirit, money, and time to their old college acquaintance, Zenia. At various times, and in various emotional disguises, Zenia has insinuated her way into their lives and practically demolished them. To Tony, who almost lost her husband and jeopardized her academic career, Zenia is &#8216;a lurking enemy??commando.&#8217; To Roz, who did lose her husband and almost her magazine, Zenia is &#8216;a cold and treacherous bitch.&#8217; To Charis, who lost a boyfriend, quarts of vegetable juice and some pet chickens, Zenia is a kind of zombie, maybe &#8216;soulless'&#8221; (Lorrie Moore, New York Times Book??Review). </p>

<p>Summary : This book presents the first in-depth study of online misogyny and the manosphere from a psychoanalytic perspective.The author argues that the men of the manosphere present contradictory thoughts, desires and fantasies about women which include but also go beyond misogyny. They are in a state of dis/inhibition: torn between (un)conscious forces and fantasies which erupt and are defended against. Dis/inhibition shows itself in self-victimization and defensive apathy as well as toxic agency and symbolic power and expresses itself in desire for and hatred of other bodies. The text draws on the psychoanalytic thinkers Klaus Theweleit, Elisabeth Young-Bruehl, Jessica Benjamin and Wilhelm Reich to present detailed analyses of the communities within the so-called manosphere, including incels, Men Going Their Own Way (MGTOW), alt-right YouTubers and NoFap users.

<p>Summary : Beth and me wedged tight, jeaned legs pressed against each other. The sound of our own breathing. Before we all stopped believing a tornado, or anything, could touch us, ever.Addy Hanlon and Beth Cassidy are tough, inseparable, invincible. No pair more charismatic or sophisticated. No pair more dangerous. But with the fall term, their new coach arrives and things begin to change. She has plans for the cheer squad: all sleek poise and cool command, the girls are soon entirely in her thrall. Faster, harder, higher, thinner, the stakes raised, their world contracting, they compete to risk ? everything. She, meantime, has been crossing a line of her own. From the brilliant author of The End of Everything, Dare Me is a searing novel about the allure of adulthood and the dark heart of adolescence: the fierce bonds between girls, their bitter rivalries, and their power to transform one another.</p>

<p>Summary : In The Big Fat Surprise, investigative journalist Nina Teicholz reveals the unthinkable: that everything we thought we knew about dietary fat is wrong.

<p>Summary : La bellezza oggi ? qualcosa di ben preciso a cui adeguarsi: un certo modo di vestire, di mangiare, di parlare, di camminare. Non si tratta di una questione puramente estetica, ma di una tecnica politica di esercizio del potere. In altre parole, di una gabbia dorata in cui non ci rendiamo conto di essere rinchiusi.L?idea che la bellezza sia qualcosa di oggettivo e naturale ? una superstizione moderna. Infatti non ? mai esistita un?epoca in cui non convivessero estetiche e sensibilit? diverse. Il culto della bellezza ? diventato una prigione solo di recente: quando le coercizioni materiali verso le donne hanno iniziato ad allentarsi, il canone estetico nei confronti del loro aspetto ? diventato rigido e asfissiante, spingendole alla ricerca di una perfezione irraggiungibile. Qui sta il punto: l?idea di bellezza ha subito con la societ? borghese uno spostamento di significato, da enigma a modello standardizzato che colonizza il tempo e i pensieri delle donne, facendole spesso sentire </p>

<p>Summary : In 1914 the Ottoman Empire was depleted of men and resources after years of war against Balkan nationalist and Italian forces. But in the aftermath of the assassination in Sarajevo, the powers of Europe were sliding inexorably toward war, and not even the Middle East could escape the vast and enduring consequences of one of the most destructive conflicts in human history.

<p>Summary : In 1914 the Ottoman Empire was depleted of men and resources after years of war against Balkan nationalist and Italian forces. But in the aftermath of the assassination in Sarajevo, the powers of Europe were sliding inexorably toward war, and not even the Middle East could escape the vast and enduring consequences of one of the most destructive conflicts in human history. The Great War spelled the end of the Ottomans, unleashing powerful forces that would forever change the face of the Middle East.In The Fall of the Ottomans, award-winning historian Eugene Rogan brings the First World War and its immediate aftermath in the Middle East to vivid life, uncovering the often ignored story of the region&#8217;s crucial role in the conflict. Bolstered by German money, arms, and military advisors, the Ottomans took on the Russian, British, and French forces, and tried to provoke Jihad against the Allies in their Muslim colonies.

<p>Summary : Questa nuova edizione degli &#8220;Elementi di antropologia culturale&#8221;, ampiamente riveduta e aggiornata anche sul piano iconografico, costituisce un&#8217;introduzione allo studio delle culture di ieri e di oggi, e fornisce gli strumenti per affrontare gli argomenti della disciplina nella pluralit? dei loro aspetti simbolici e materiali, sociali ed economici, politici e religiosi, estetici ed ecologici. La carica innovativa di questo testo risiede nello sforzo che l&#8217;autore ha compiuto &#8211; anche attraverso l&#8217;illustrazione di numerosi casi etnografici &#8211; per intrecciare l&#8217;esposizione delle specifiche realt? culturali con i paradigmi interpretativi offerti dalla ricerca teorica pi? recente. Il libro risulta un&#8217;introduzione indispensabile al significato di parole, concetti e idee con le quali potremo meglio comprendere le culture e le societ? umane nel loro incontro sulla scena del mondo contemporaneo.</p>

<p>Summary : In this brilliant and widely acclaimed work, Peter Burke presents a social and cultural history of the Italian Renaissance. He discusses the social and political institutions that existed in Italy during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, and he analyses the ways of thinking and seeing that characterized this period of extraordinary artistic creativity.Developing a distinctive sociological approach, Peter Burke is concerned not only with the finished works of Michelangelo, Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci, and others, but also with the social background, patterns of recruitment, and means of subsistence of this ?cultural elite.? He thus makes a major contribution to our understanding of the Italian Renaissance, and to our comprehension of the complex relations between culture and society.Burke has thoroughly revised and updated the text for this new edition, including a new introduction, and the book is richly illustrated throughout. It will have a wide appeal among historians, </p>

<p>Summary : Have you heard the rumor around campus about the locker room?If you haven&#8217;t, let me enlighten you: Legend has it if you bring a girl into the sacred after-game domain of the baseball locker room, it will end with a walk down the aisle. One rowdy and naked encounter against the lockers with the girl of your dreams will make her your wife. Translation: baseball players are stupidly superstitious and believe the locker room has magical powers. But not all baseball players are superstitious, me included. So when the girl I&#8217;ve fallen for brushes me off, I start to question if I need to switch my way of thinking. Maybe it&#8217;s time I finally hand out a coveted invitation to the locker room. The only question is, will she accept?</p>

<p>Summary : Have you heard the rumor around campus about the locker room?If you haven&#8217;t, let me enlighten you: Legend has it if you bring a girl into the sacred after-game domain of the baseball locker room, it will end with a walk down the aisle. One rowdy and naked encounter against the lockers with the girl of your dreams will make her your wife. Translation: baseball players are stupidly superstitious and believe the locker room has magical powers. But not all baseball players are superstitious, me included. So when the girl I&#8217;ve fallen for brushes me off, I start to question if I need to switch my way of thinking. Maybe it&#8217;s time I finally hand out a coveted invitation to the locker room. The only question is, will she accept?</p>

<p>Summary : In Empires and Colonies in the Modern World: A Global Perspective, Heather Streets-Salter and Trevor R. Getz provide a thorough overview of modern empires and colonialism from the late fifteenth century to the present. Synthesizing the vast outpouring of new scholarship that examines empires in a global context, the book pays as much attention to the Ottoman, Mughal, Ming, and Qing Empires as to European colonialism, and stresses the continuous social, political, and cultural interactions between colonizers and colonized. Amply illustrated with photographs and full-color maps, Empires and Colonies in the Modern World examines numerous issues&#8211;including commodity flows, pan-movements, and anti-colonial activism&#8211;that superseded the boundaries of colonies and empires entirely. It calls attention not only to the complexities of the internal dynamics of individual empires, but also to the constant interactions between empires, and between colonies with different national metropoles.</p>

<p>Summary : NATIONAL BESTSELLER ? Set in a close-knit Newark neighborhood during a terrifying polio outbreak in 1944, a ?book [that] has the elegance of a fable and the tragic inevitability of a Greek drama? ( The New Yorker )?from the Pulitzer Prize?winning author of American Pastoral .Bucky Cantor is a vigorous, dutiful twenty-three-year-old playground director during the summer of 1944. A javelin thrower and weightlifter, he is disappointed with himself because his weak eyes have excluded him from serving in the war alongside his contemporaries. As the devastating disease begins to ravage Bucky?s playground, Roth leads us through every inch of emotion such a pestilence can breed: fear, panic, anger, bewilderment, suffering, and pain. Moving between the streets of Newark and a pristine summer camp high in the Poconos, Nemesis tenderly and startlingly depicts Cantor?s passage into personal disaster, the condition of childhood, and the painful effect that the wartime polio epidemic has on a </p>

<p>Summary : This richly illustrated anthology gathers together classic short stories from masters of supernatural fiction including M.R. James, Sheridan Le Fanu and Arthur Machen, alongside lesser-known voices in the field including Eleanor Scott and Margery Lawrence, and popular writers less bound to the horror genre, such as Thomas Hardy and E.F. Benson.These are damnable tales, selected and beautifully illustrated by Richard Wells. They stalk the moors at night, the deep forests, cornered fields and dusky churchyards, the narrow lanes and old ways of these ancient places, drawing upon the haunted landscapes of folk-horror ? a now widely used term first applied to a series of British films from the late 1960s and 1970s: Witchfinder General (1968), Blood on Satan?s Claw(1971), and The Wicker Man (1973).But as this collection shows, writers of uncanny fiction were dabbling in the dark side of folklore long before. These twenty-two stories take the reader beyond the safety and familiarity of the </p>

James, Sheridan Le Fanu and Arthur Machen, alongside lesser-known voices in the field including Eleanor Scott and Margery Lawrence, and popular writers less bound to the horror genre, such as Thomas Hardy and E.F. Benson.These are damnable tales, selected and beautifully illustrated by Richard Wells.

<p>Summary : Science communication is a rapidly expanding area, and a key component of many final year undergraduate and postgraduate courses. Authored by a highly regarded chemist and science communicator, this textbook pulls together all aspects of science communication. Complete Science Communication focusses on four major aspects of science communication: writing for non-technical audiences and science journalism; writing for technical audiences and peer-reviewed journal writing; public speaking of science; and public relations. It first showcases how writing in a journalistic style is done and provides a guide for colloquially communicating science. Then, the art of writing scientific papers is conjoined to this idea to make technical manuscripts more digestible, readable, and, hence, citable. These ideas are next taken into the spoken word so that the scientist can engage in telling their science like that natural human art of campfire stories. Finally, all of these communication concepts </p>

<p>Summary : ?The fact is, if we followed the history of every little country in the world ? in its dramatic as well as its quiet times ? we would have no space left in which to live our own lives or apply ourselves to our necessary tasks, never mind indulge in occasional pleasures, like swimming . . .?First published in The New Yorker, The Embassy of Cambodia is a rare and brilliant story that takes us deep into the life of a young woman, Fatou, domestic servant to the Derawals and escapee from one set of hardships to another. Beginning and ending outside the Embassy of Cambodia, which happens to be located in Willesden, NW London, Zadie Smith&#8217;s absorbing, moving and wryly observed story suggests how the apparently small things in an ordinary life always raise larger, more extraordinary questions.</p>

<p>Summary : I thought I understood power.My parents taught me that magic attracts equal danger, and everything I&#8217;ve seen since becoming a demon contractor confirms it. I&#8217;ve witnessed how power twists and corrupts&#8211;and I&#8217;ve tasted power no human should wield.I thought I knew greed.Ambition and avarice drove my family into hiding. My parents died for someone else&#8217;s greed. I&#8217;ve never hunted anything in my life, but now I&#8217;m hunting their killer&#8211;with my demon&#8217;s help.I thought I&#8217;d seen evil.But with each step closer to my parents&#8217; murderer, I&#8217;m uncovering a different sort of evil, piece by hidden piece. I&#8217;ve stumbled into an insidious web that silently, secretly ensnares everything it touches. My demon and I came as the hunters&#8230;&#8230;but I think we might be the prey.&#8211;Author&#8217;s Note: The Guild Codex includes two series, Demonized and Spellbound, which can be read and enjoyed all on their own; however, this book contains spoilers for Demon Magic and a Martini (Spellbound #4).

<p>Summary : Die Theorie der Kunst steht heute vor enormen Herausforderungen. Die Grenzen zwischen den K?nsten sind ebenso por?s geworden wie die zwischen Kunst und Nichtkunst. Was aber definiert die Kunst, wenn sie nicht mehr zwingend durch die alten Gattungen bestimmt wird?

<p>Summary : Die Theorie der Kunst steht heute vor enormen Herausforderungen. Die Grenzen zwischen den K?nsten sind ebenso por?s geworden wie die zwischen Kunst und Nichtkunst. Was aber definiert die Kunst, wenn sie nicht mehr zwingend durch die alten Gattungen bestimmt wird? Wie l?sst sich dann ?berhaupt noch sinnvoll zwischen Werken vergleichen, wie ?ber ihre Qualit?t urteilen? Und was hei?t das alles f?r die Geschichte der Kunst? Was folgt aus der Destabilisierung der Grenze zwischen Kunst und Wirklichkeit? Gibt es in dieser Situation noch so etwas wie eine spezifische Politik der Kunst, und wenn ja, wie w?re sie zu denken?

<p>Summary : El profesor Eduardo Manzano nos ofrece en este libro una visi?n renovadora de una de las ?pocas m?s oscuras y controvertidas de la historia de la Pen?nsula Ib?rica: los tres siglos que siguieron a la conquista ?rabe de 711, durante los cuales un territorio cristiano y romanizado, conocido como Hispania, se transform? en al-Andalus, musulm?n y ?rabe, y uno de los centros culturales m?s brillantes del mundo. La obra es fruto de un extraordinario esfuerzo de investigaci?n, que no solo se ha basado en una lectura cr?tica de las fuentes ?rabes y latinas, sino que se ha enriquecido con las aportaciones m?s recientes de la arqueolog?a y la numism?tica, que iluminan y matizan en muchas ocasiones lo que cuentan las fuentes escritas.</p>

<p>Summary : Every family has secrets?dark ones, twisted ones, ones they hide. The Ivory family is no different. From the outside of their gated estate, one would see a beautiful, wealthy family. But the more perfect they seem, it only shows how many imperfections they are trying to bury. When Demi Rao, a young woman is at her wits? end and on the run from escaping her captor, she comes across an employment ad from the Ivory family, looking for someone to help maintain their elaborate estate. Although the ad is strange with meticulous directions to wear all-white, no makeup and speak quietly, Demi applies. With no choices, Demi gets and accepts the job and when she does, she quickly realizes she?s not there to clean, she?s there for a purpose. They picked her. They chose her. They?ve always known her. Behind the doors of the pristine estate lies secrets, a lethal human experiment and Demi?s entire life planned out for her.The Ivory?s have picked a favorite girl.And it might just be her.This novel </p>

<p>Summary : Gideon Cross. As beautiful and flawless on the outside as he was damaged and tormented on the inside. He was a bright, scorching flame that singed me with the darkest of pleasures. I couldn&#8217;t stay away. I didn&#8217;t want to. He was my addiction . . . my every desire . . . mine.My past was as violent as his, and I was just as broken. We&#8217;d never work. It was too hard, too painful . . . except when it was perfect. Those moments when the driving hunger and desperate love were the most exquisite insanity.We were bound by our need. And our passion would take us beyond our limits to the sweetest, sharpest edge of obsession . . .</p>

<p>Summary : A Choice of Anglo-Saxon Verse contains the Old English texts of all the major short poems, such as &#8216;The Battle of Maldon&#8217;, &#8216;The Dream of the Rood&#8217;, &#8216;The Wanderer&#8217; and &#8216;The Seafarer&#8217;, as well as a generous representation of the many important fragments, riddles and gnomic verses that survive from the seventh to the twelfth centuries, with facing-page verse translations. These poems are the well-spring of the English poetic tradition, and this anthology provides a unique window into the mind and culture of the Anglo-Saxons.The volume is an essential companion to Faber&#8217;s edition of Beowulf, translated by Seamus Heaney.</p>

These poems are the well-spring of the English poetic tradition, and this anthology provides a unique window into the mind and culture of the Anglo-Saxons.The volume is an essential companion to Faber&#8217;s edition of Beowulf, translated by Seamus Heaney.</p>

<p>Summary : The classic study of the creative process from the bestselling author of?FlowCreativity is about capturing those moments that make life worth living. Legendary psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (?The leading researcher into ?flow states.??????Newsweek) reveals what leads to these moments?be it the excitement of the artist at the easel or the scientist in the lab?so that this knowledge can be used to enrich people&#8217;s lives. Drawing on nearly one hundred interviews with exceptional people, from biologists and physicists, to politicians and business leaders, to poets and artists, as well as his thirty years of research on the subject, Csikszentmihalyi uses his famous flow theory to explore the creative process. He discusses such ideas as why creative individuals are often seen as selfish and arrogant, and why the &#8220;tortured genius&#8221; is largely a myth. Most important, he explains why creativity needs to be cultivated and is necessary for the future of our country, if not the world.</p>

Legendary psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (?The leading researcher into ?flow states.??????Newsweek) reveals what leads to these moments?be it the excitement of the artist at the easel or the scientist in the lab?so that this knowledge can be used to enrich people&amp;#8217;s lives. Drawing on nearly one hundred interviews with exceptional people, from biologists and physicists, to politicians and business leaders, to poets and artists, as well as his thirty years of research on the subject, Csikszentmihalyi uses his famous flow theory to explore the creative process. He discusses such ideas as why creative individuals are often seen as selfish and arrogant, and why the &amp;#8220;tortured genius&amp;#8221; is largely a myth. Most important, he explains why creativity needs to be cultivated and is necessary for the future of our country, if not the world.

<p>Summary : A story of a larger than life hunter and poacher told by one of South Africa?s most popular travel and adventure writers. This is the story of legendary hunter/poacher S.C. &#8216;Bvekenya&#8217; Barnard who lived in the Limpopo River region. It tells of his hunting expeditions that revolved around Crook&#8217;s Corner, where he could take refuge from the country&#8217;s police. An outlaw for twenty years, Bvekenya was one of the most colorful personalities in Africa, who fought a one-man war against all control and authority. The life of Bvekenya and his exploits as an ivory poacher, blackbirder, outdoorsman and perhaps surprisingly for some, a conservationist, was told to Bulpin by Barnard himself.</p>

<p>Summary : Finland, Cultural Lone Wolf is the story of an accomplished nation and her extraordinary people. By pursuing a &#8216;Lone Wolf&#8217; policy, Finland raised itself from a struggling, war-battered state to one of the most developed countries in the world over the course of only fifty years. The exponential rise of Nokia from tires and timbers to leading the world&#8217;s telecommunication industry is indicative of the Finns and their business style. These remarkable people speak a language unique in its origins and have kept their cultural identity intact despite the influences of powerful neighbors, Sweden and Russia.Uniquely qualified to write about Finland, best-selling author Richard Lewis traces the fascinating Finnish origins, as well as her history, geography, values and culture. His extensive experience with Finnish business provides him with keen insight on leadership style, negotiation strategies and the uniquely Finnish suomi-kuva, or Finland image. Lewis shines when describing Finnish </p>

<p>Summary : Inghilterra, 1863E se la storia di Alice in Wonderland fosse diversa da quella che vi hanno sempre raccontato? Se Alice non avesse seguito il coniglio nella tana, preferendo invece ascoltare i sussurri di un pazzo cappellaio?Quando Alison Wheeler partecipa all?inaugurazione della metropolitana di Londra, non si aspetta certo di finire tra le braccia di un misterioso gentiluomo e, nel medesimo istante, nelle mire di un duca libertino. Solo per curiosit?, accetta la corte del nobile e il suo invito a un ballo in maschera, ma niente ? come sembra. Alison si ritrova presto invischiata in una strana e scabrosa situazione.Smarrita tra veleni, invidie e tradimenti, divisa tra le lusinghe del Bianconiglio e la follia di un Cappellaio, Alison dovr? trovare la sua strada, mentre Mr Solomon Tucker, il sarto pi? famoso di tutta Londra, imparer? a sue spese che ? impossibile resistere alla potenza del vero amore.</p>

<p>Summary : Cuando las ideolog?as, desorientadas, nos dejan tirado en la cuneta, apenas nos sobreponemos de nuestra perplejidad comenzamos a buscar el sentido de la vida. Antes o despu?s, acabamos por hacernos la siguiente pregunta: ?Y por qu? no probar con la filosof?a? S?, pero ?d?nde, como, con qu? m?todo y, sobre todo, con qui?n? Porque, en realidad, no se filosofa con la filosof?a, sino con fil?sofos. Y, como hay tantos, la dificultad consiste en elegirlo(s) sin perdernos irremediablemente en los manuales y las enciclopedias. Estudiar a fondo el pensamiento de los grandes te?ricos y extraer de ?l un m?todo de reflexi?n eficaz es una misi?n imposible si adem?s pretendemos seguir llevando una vida m?s o menos normal. Por eso, el autor de esta obra tan divertida como seria nos propone v?as que a primera vista parecen sorprendentes, pero que resultan muy f?ciles en la pr?ctica. Una lleva a conocer la vida y la personalidad del fil?sofo: la v?a de las afinidades; la otra consiste en escoger </p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  ?Why is the one person I hate the only guy I can?t stop thinking about?? <br />
 West, my older brother?s high school rival. The rich kid who has it all. The guy who disappeared six years ago and destroyed my brother?s life. I thought West and I were friends. I trusted him, but he showed me I was nothing more to him than a means to an end. Being twenty and in my last year of college isn?t easy. Neither is being a virgin. I?ve never been normal or felt like I fit in, and I don?t feel what I?m supposed to. My online job has given me the perfect way to solve my virginity problem, but then the last person I ever wanted to see again shows up on my doorstep. Not only has West learned what I do for a living, he?s essentially my landlord. I hate him. So why can?t I stay away from him? Why is he the only person I?ve ever felt a connection with, who makes me feel like there?s something in me worth wanting? Eli and West?s story is an enemies-to-friends-to-lovers romance between a former bad boy who </p>

I?ve never been normal or felt like I fit in, and I don?t feel what I?m supposed to. My online job has given me the perfect way to solve my virginity problem, but then the last person I ever wanted to see again shows up on my doorstep. Not only has West learned what I do for a living, he?s essentially my landlord. I hate him. So why can?t I stay away from him? Why is he the only person I?ve ever felt a connection with, who makes me feel like there?s something in me worth wanting?

<p>Summary : Mohammad Ali Jinnah has been both celebrated and reviled for his role in the Partition of India, and the controversies surrounding his actions have only increased in the seven decades and more since his death. Ishtiaq Ahmed places Jinnah&#8217;s actions under intense scrutiny to ascertain the Quaid-i-Azam&#8217;s successes and failures and the meaning and significance of his legacy. Using a wealth of contemporary records and archival material, Dr Ahmed traces Jinnah&#8217;s journey from Indian nationalist to Muslim communitarian, and from a Muslim nationalist to, finally, Pakistan&#8217;s all-powerful head of state. How did the ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity become the inflexible votary of the two-nation theory? Did Jinnah envision Pakistan as a theocratic state? What was his position on Gandhi and federalism? Asking these crucial questions against the backdrop of the turbulent struggle against colonialism, this book is a path-breaking examination of one of the most controversial figures of the twentieth </p>

<p>Summary : A charming, practical, and unsentimental approach to putting a home in order while reflecting on the tiny joys that make up a long life.In Sweden there is a kind of decluttering called d?st?dning, d? meaning ?death? and st?dning meaning ?cleaning.? This surprising and invigorating process of clearing out unnecessary belongings can be undertaken at any age or life stage but should be done sooner than later, before others have to do it for you. In The Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning, artist Margareta Magnusson, with Scandinavian humor and wisdom, instructs readers to embrace minimalism. Her radical and joyous method for putting things in order helps families broach sensitive conversations, and makes the process uplifting rather than overwhelming.Margareta suggests which possessions you can easily get rid of (unworn clothes, unwanted presents, more plates than you?d ever use) and which you might want to keep (photographs, love letters, a few of your children?s art projects). </p>
