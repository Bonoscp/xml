<p>Summary : He&#8217;s caught only a glimpse of her from the window of his carriage, but the young Russian prince knew he had to have her. Within minutes, Lady Katherine St. John was dragged from the London street like a common waif and carries off to a sumptuous town house?for the pleasure of her noble admirer. But it was a captive tigress Prince Dimitri found in his bed?consumed with a fierce rage toward the Russian ?barbarian? who had kidnapped her?even as she found herself desiring this tawny-maned Adonis with a hunger beyond her understanding?From the tempestuous passion of that first encounter, across stormy seas, to the golden splendor of palaces in Moscow, she was his prisoner. But even as her fury defied his bold claim of ownership, an all-consuming need made her his slave. For theirs was a fever that fed upon itself, carrying them irrevocably toward a final surrender to the power of undeniable love.</p>

<p>Summary : Joe is done with the cities. He?s done with the muck and the posers, done with Love. Now, he?s saying hello to nature, to simple pleasures on a cozy island in the Pacific Northwest. For the first time in a long time, he can just breathe.He gets a job at the local library?he does know a thing or two about books?and that?s where he meets her: Mary Kay DiMarco. Librarian. Joe won?t meddle; he will not obsess. He?ll win her the old-fashioned way: by providing a shoulder to cry on, a helping hand. Over time, they?ll both heal their wounds and begin their happily ever after in this sleepy town.The trouble is, Mary Kay already has a life. She?s a mother. She?s a friend. She?s busy.True love can only triumph if both people are willing to make room for the real thing. Joe cleared his decks. He?s ready. And hopefully, with his encouragement and undying support, Mary Kay will do the right thing and make room for him.</p>

<p>Summary : ?Literacy? is far more than the ability to read and write. Its definition implies much about our capacity to obtain and master knowledge generally and offers an opportunity and grounds for the basis of mastery. Data Literacy provides an amazing framework that will allow a mobile data spreader to move from a crawler to a walking knowledge worker to a running data professional should they so choose. Another masterpiece from the visionary that taught us that data is ?soil? not ?oil?! &#8211;Michael Leahy, Maryland Secretary of Technology?Data.? The word itself places a different image in your mind today than it did 20 years ago, which makes sense. Data is different. Aiken and Harbour present a thorough view of how data has become an anthropological movement and what organizations and individuals need to do. Data has entered all aspects of society. Aiken and Harbour present a thorough treatment of what you need to look out for and what to do about data in all of its forms. &#8211;John Ladley, </p>

<p>Summary : She waited on tables as usual that day, her twentieth birthday. She always worked Fridays, but if things had gone according to plan on that particular Friday, she would have had the night off. One rainy Tokyo night, a waitress?s uneventful twentieth birthday takes a strange and fateful turn when she?s asked to deliver dinner to the restaurant?s reclusive owner. Birthday Girl is a beguiling, exquisitely satisfying taste of master storytelling, published to celebrate Murakami?s 70th birthday.</p>

<p>Summary : She waited on tables as usual that day, her twentieth birthday. She always worked Fridays, but if things had gone according to plan on that particular Friday, she would have had the night off. One rainy Tokyo night, a waitress?s uneventful twentieth birthday takes a strange and fateful turn when she?s asked to deliver dinner to the restaurant?s reclusive owner. Birthday Girl is a beguiling, exquisitely satisfying taste of master storytelling, published to celebrate Murakami?s 70th birthday.</p>

<p>Summary : From a former senior advisor to Senator John McCain, an urgent wake-up call about how new technologies are threatening America&#8217;s military might.When we think about the future of war, the military and Washington and most everyone gets it backwards. We think in terms of buying single military systems, such as fighter jets or aircraft carriers. And when we think about modernizing those systems, we think about buying better versions of the same things. But what really matters is not the single system but the battle network &#8212; the collection of sensors and shooters that enables a military to find an enemy system, target it, and attack it. This process is what the military calls the kill chain &#8212; how you get from detection to action, and do it as quickly as possible. The future of war is not about buying better versions of the same systems we have always had; it is about buying faster, better kill chains.As former Staff Director for the Senate Armed Services Committee and senior policy </p>

<p>Summary : There are worse things than death. Things that lurk in the shadows and slip into your dreams. Things that have no business existing. Things that once slept ? but have now awoken.  For Callypso Lillis, the fae magic that now runs through her veins is equal parts curse and good fortune. For the very thing that bonds her to Desmond Flynn, the King of the Night, also makes her vulnerable to the Thief of Souls, a man who wants to break the world ? and Callie along with it.  But it?s not just the Thief whose shadow looms over the Otherworld. Des?s father is back from the dead, and he wants revenge on the son who sent him to the grave in the first place.  Des and Callie must figure out how to stop both men, and time is running out. Because there are forces at play working to tear the lovers apart once and for all ? and unfortunately for them, death is no longer the worst thing to fear.</p>

<p>Summary : Myriam Gurba&#8217;s debut is the bold and hilarious tale of her coming of age as a queer, mixed-race Chicana. Blending radical formal fluidity and caustic humor, Mean turns what might be tragic into piercing, revealing comedy. This is a confident, funny, brassy book that takes the cost of sexual assault, racism, misogyny, and homophobia deadly seriously.We act mean to defend ourselves from boredom and from those who would cut off our breasts. We act mean to defend our clubs and institutions. We act mean because we like to laugh. Being mean to boys is fun and a second-wave feminist duty. Being mean to men who deserve it is a holy mission. Sisterhood is powerful, but being mean is more exhilarating.Being mean isn&#8217;t for everybody.Being mean is best practiced by those who understand it as an art form.These virtuosos live closer to the divine than the rest of humanity. They&#8217;re queers.Myriam Gurba is a queer spoken-word performer, visual artist, and writer from Santa Maria, California. She&#8217;s </p>

Blending radical formal fluidity and caustic humor, Mean turns what might be tragic into piercing, revealing comedy. This is a confident, funny, brassy book that takes the cost of sexual assault, racism, misogyny, and homophobia deadly seriously.We act mean to defend ourselves from boredom and from those who would cut off our breasts. We act mean to defend our clubs and institutions. We act mean because we like to laugh. Being mean to boys is fun and a second-wave feminist duty. Being mean to men who deserve it is a holy mission. Sisterhood is powerful, but being mean is more exhilarating.Being mean isn&amp;#8217;t for everybody.Being mean is best practiced by those who understand it as an art form.These virtuosos live closer to the divine than the rest of humanity. They&amp;#8217;re queers.Myriam Gurba is a queer spoken-word performer, visual artist, and writer from Santa Maria, California.

<p>Summary : Princess Eadlyn has grown up hearing endless stories about how her mother and father met. Twenty years ago, America Singer entered the Selection and won the heart of Prince Maxon &#8211; and they lived happily ever after. Eadlyn has always found their fairy-tale story romantic, but she has no interest in trying to repeat it. If it were up to her, she&#8217;d put off marriage for as long as possible.But a princess&#8217;s life is never entirely her own, and Eadlyn can&#8217;t escape her very own Selection?no matter how fervently she protests.Eadlyn doesn&#8217;t expect her story to end in romance. But as the competition begins, one entry may just capture Eadlyn&#8217;s heart, showing her all the possibilities that lie in front of her . . . and proving that finding her own happily ever after isn&#8217;t as impossible as she&#8217;s always thought.</p>

<p>Summary : ASIN B086GM3R68 moved to the more recent editionSutton Spencer?s ideas for her life were fairly simple: finish graduate school and fall in love. It would be a lot simpler if she could pinpoint exactly what she should do when she graduates in less than a year. Oh, and if she could figure out how to talk to a woman without feeling completely hopeless, that would be great too.Charlotte Thompson is very much the opposite. She&#8217;s always had clear steps outlining her path to success with no time or inclination for romance. Her burgeoning career in politics means everything to her and she?s not willing to compromise it for something as insignificant as love. Fleeting, casual, and discreet worked perfectly fine. When they meet through a dating app, it&#8217;s immediately clear that they aren&#8217;t suited for anything more than friendship. Right?</p>

<p>Summary : Happiness is an everyday term in our lives, and most of us strive to be happy. But defining happiness can be difficult. In this Very Short Introduction, Dan Haybron considers the true nature of happiness. By examining what it is, assessing its subjective values, its importance in our lives, and how we can (and should) pursue it, he considers the current thinking on happiness, from psychology to philosophy. Illustrating the diverse routes to happiness, Haybron reflects on the growing influence of secular Western ideas in the contemporary pursuit of a good life, and considers the influence of social context on our satisfaction and well-being. About the Series: Oxford&#8217;s Very Short Introductions series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects&#8211;from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible. Not simply a textbook of definitions, each volume in this series provides trenchant and provocative&#8211;yet always </p>

But everything changes when Patrick, a distraught husband, comes to look for traces of his drowned wife in Edie. The more time that Edie spends as the glamorous, enigmatic Sylvia, the closer she comes to falling in love with Patrick, and the more mysterious the circumstances around Sylvia&#8217;s death appear.As Edie falls under Sylvia&#8217;s spell, she must discover not only the couple&#8217;s darkest secrets but also her own long-buried memories and desires &#8211; before it&#8217;s too late.</p>

<p>Summary : Two husbands dead; a life marred by sadness. And now Katharine is in love for the first time in her life. The eye of an ageing and dangerous king falls upon her. She cannot refuse him. She must stifle her feelings and never betray that she wanted another. And now she is the sixth wife. Her queenship is a holy mission yet, fearfully, she dreams of the tragic parade of women who went before her. She cherishes the secret beliefs that could send her to the fire. And still the King loves and trusts her.  Now her enemies are closing in. She must fight for her very life. KATHARINE PARR ? the last of Henry?s queens.  Alison Weir recounts the extraordinary story of a woman forced into a perilous situation and rising heroically to the challenge. Katharine is a delightful woman, a warm and kindly heroine ? and yet she will be betrayed by those she loves and trusts most.  Too late, the truth will dawn on her.</p>

ARE THEY SMART ENOUGH TO LEAVE HER ALONE?A teenaged loner who sees more than she should, Alice Brickstone?s mission in life is to find out who or what killed her twin brother a decade earlier.

When she begins to see faces from her childhood nightmares, Alice buries her fear and pounces on the opportunity to hunt for information?and revenge. She works alone and observes no caution. Her simple mission is complicated when a strange Himalayan hermit shows up in the woods near her house telling her that she has paranormal abilities. Skeptical but determined to use any advantage to end the threat against her, she is shocked to suddenly become the hunted. There is only one way out?Alice must master her newfound skills and fly before tragedy takes over again.GIRL IN THE AIR is the first book in a series of </p>

La escultura, edici?n p?stuma de una serie de conferencias pronunciadas en la Universidad de Cambridge en 1970-1971, no es una historia de la escultura occidental ni un manual de t?cnicas, sino una indagaci?n en un campo menos explorado: la interacci?n de procedimientos de trabajo y principios formales, interacci?n que en el caso de la pl?stica determina, de manera m?s esencial y tangible que en otras artes, el car?cter final de la obra y la formaci?n de los estilos individuales y colectivos.

<p>Summary : Thinking Critically teaches the fundamental thinking, reasoning, reading, and writing abilities that students need for academic success. The text begins with basic skills related to personal experience and then carefully progresses to the more sophisticated reasoning skills required for abstract, academic contexts. Thinking Critically is designed to introduce students to the cognitive process while teaching them to develop their higher order thinking and language abilities. The book has a number of distinctive characteristics that make it an effective tool for both instructors and students. Exercises, discussion topics, and writing assignments encourage active participation, stimulating students to critically examine their own and others&#8217; thinking. Thinking Critically is a proven, classroom-tested vehicle for introducing students to the thinking process and helping them develop sophisticated critical-thinking and critical-literacy abilities. <br />

But when a familiar face appears?the older brother of her childhood friend?and offers help, Gigi seems to have caught a break. Alec Kim is handsome, humble, and kind?exactly the sort of man that Gigi has forgotten existed after her own painful heartbreaks. An evening of reconnection followed by a night of no-strings-attached passion with Alec feels like a gift?that is, until Gigi finally realizes that their childhood connection isn?t the only reason he seems so familiar to her.Alec is determined to prove to Gigi that he is truly the man she thinks he is, even if it means coming clean about his fame?and his family?s connection to the story Gigi?s been working so hard to break. But as their feelings for each other grow deeper, Gigi and Alec must navigate a new reality?one where </p>

<p>Summary : For suspense-filled, post-apocalyptic thrillers, Wool is more than a self-published ebook phenomenon?it?s the new standard in classic science fiction.In a ruined and toxic future, a community exists in a giant silo underground, hundreds of stories deep. There, men and women live in a society full of regulations they believe are meant to protect them. Sheriff Holston, who has unwaveringly upheld the silo?s rules for years, unexpectedly breaks the greatest taboo of all: He asks to go outside.His fateful decision unleashes a drastic series of events. An unlikely candidate is appointed to replace him: Juliette, a mechanic with no training in law, whose special knack is fixing machines. Now Juliette is about to be entrusted with fixing her silo, and she will soon learn just how badly her world is broken. The silo is about to confront what its history has only hinted about and its inhabitants have never dared to whisper. Uprising.A New York Times and USA TODAY bestseller, as well as Kindle </p>

<p>Summary : Estamos perdiendo nuestra capacidad de no hacer nada. Nuestra existencia est? completamente absorbida por la actividad y, por lo tanto, completamente explotada. Dado que solo percibimos la vida en terminos de rendimiento, tendemos a entender la inactividad como un deficit, una negaci?n o una mera ausencia de actividad cuando se trata, muy al contrario, de una interesante capacidad independiente. Byung-Chul Han indaga en los beneficios, el esplendor y la magia de la ociosidad y dise?a una nueva forma de vida, que incluya momentos contemplativos, con la que afrontar la crisis actual de nuestra sociedad y frenar nuestra propia explotaci?n y la destrucci?n de la naturaleza.</p>

A land where witches wear their spells like tattoos is no place for a woman without a single magical mark?except for Raven, whose unblemished skin contradicts the truth of her power. Surviving under the scowls of her fellow witches has carved indelible scars into her mind over the years?just as the day she watched the Dark King&#8217;s men murder her grandmother in cold blood. But the Dark King&#8217;s reign of terror is far-reaching, and Raven&#8217;s grandmother won&#8217;t be the last witch to die under his rule. After the death of a coven leader heralds the start of the infamous Witch Trials, Raven finds herself dodging death to triumph.

<p>Summary : ALL RAVEN WANTS IS PEACE. BUT IN A MAGICAL REALM PLAGUED BY DECEPTION, THE ONLY THING HER WORLD KNOWS IS TURMOIL. A land where witches wear their spells like tattoos is no place for a woman without a single magical mark?except for Raven, whose unblemished skin contradicts the truth of her power. Surviving under the scowls of her fellow witches has carved indelible scars into her mind over the years?just as the day she watched the Dark King&#8217;s men murder her grandmother in cold blood. But the Dark King&#8217;s reign of terror is far-reaching, and Raven&#8217;s grandmother won&#8217;t be the last witch to die under his rule. After the death of a coven leader heralds the start of the infamous Witch Trials, Raven finds herself dodging death to triumph.

Still, trust is always fragile in kingdoms ruled by magic, especially when love enters the fold. Yet, </p>

<p>Summary : When a vagrant?the Walking Man?finds a dog wandering alone with the words &#8220;HELP US? written on its collar, he?s sure it?s a desperate plea from someone in trouble and calls on Detective Inspector Jack Caffery to investigate. Caffery is reluctant to get involved?until the Walking Man promises new information regarding the childhood abduction of Caffery?s brother in exchange for the detective?s help tracking down the dog?s owners. Caffery has no idea who or what he is searching for, but one thing he is sure of: it&#8217;s a race against time.Meanwhile, the Anchor-Ferrers, a wealthy local family, are fighting for their lives in their remote home ten miles away. Two men have tricked their way into the house and are holding the family for ransom. Yet as the captors? demands become increasingly bizarre and humiliating, it becomes clear that this is more than a random crime?it?s a personal vendetta.</p>

<p>Summary : A winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and bestselling author of Banker to the Poor offers his vision of an emerging new economic system that can save humankind and the planet  Muhammad Yunus, who created microcredit, invented social business, and earned a Nobel Peace Prize for his work in alleviating poverty, is one of today&#8217;s most trenchant social critics. Now he declares it&#8217;s time to admit that the capitalist engine is broken&#8211;that in its current form it inevitably leads to rampant inequality, massive unemployment, and environmental destruction. We need a new economic system that unleashes altruism as a creative force just as powerful as self-interest.  Is this a pipe dream? Not at all.

<p>Summary : An alternate cover edition can be found here.Dante Marcello?s life has been a carefully planned event as an heir to a Cosa Nostra throne. For as long as he can remember, he?s had one goal in mind, and that?s becoming the Don. With his father ready to step down, it?s Dante?s turn to step up. But without a wife at his side, his seat as the boss is on shaky ground. Until she shows up with an offer he wants to refuse, but can?t.With her, he?s got everything to gain.Catrina Danzi is known for her angel face and a predator?s grace. For over a decade, she?s worked as a successful Queen Pin dealing with a repertoire of clientele who can?t afford a scandal. That?s why they ask for her and why they call her Queen. Marrying Dante Marcello means giving up the business and status she loves in order to gain protection she can?t provide on her own, but she no longer has a choice.Without him, she?s got everything to lose. The rules for their arrangement are simple: no intimacy, no emotions. Dante </p>

He has raised her on stories of early man, taken her to witness rare artifacts, recounted time and again their rituals and beliefs?particularly their sacrifices to the bog. Mixing with the students, Silvie begins to see, hear, and imagine another kind of life, one that might include going to university, traveling beyond England, choosing her own clothes and food, speaking her mind.The ancient Britons built ghost walls to ward off enemy invaders, rude </p>

Quando finalmente arriva, lei ? al settimo cielo, incurante dei segnali che dovrebbero metterla in guardia. Convinta che il suo amore baster? per entrambi. Ignara che Tom ha un&#8217;altra vita.

<p>Summary : This masterful survey of world religions presents a clear and concise portrait of the history, beliefs, and practices of Eastern and Western religions. The new edition contains added material and has been revised throughout. The authors, both respected scholars of world religions, have over fifty years of teaching experience combined. Their book is accessibly written for introductory classes, can be easily adapted for one- or two-semester courses, and presents a neutral approach for broad classroom use. Pedagogical aids include further reading suggestions, photographs, sidebars, and pronunciation guides. Useful resources for professors are available upon request, including over 250 PowerPoint/Keynote slides and a multiple-choice question database with over 800 questions.</p>

<p>Summary : In the second Godwicks novel, the bestselling author of The Red &#8220;transmutes spicy mythological tales into sensual fantasies and erotic romance&#8221; (Publishers Weekly, starred review).On the day of Lia Godwick&#8217;s university graduation party, her parents&#8211;wealthy art collectors with friends in high places&#8211;gift her a beautiful wine cup, a rare artifact decorated with roses. It&#8217;s a stunning gift, and one that August Bowman, a friend of her parents and a guest at Lia&#8217;s party, also has his eye on. The cup, August tells her, is known as the Rose Kylix, and it&#8217;s no ordinary cup. It was used in the temple ceremonies of Eros, Greek god of erotic love, and has the power to bring the most intimate sexual fantasies to life.But Lia is skeptical of August&#8217;s claims of the cup&#8217;s mythology and magic&#8211;after all, he&#8217;s a collector himself, and she suspects he just wants to get his hands on this impressive piece of art. So he dares her to try it for herself, and when Lia drinks from the Rose Kylix she is </p>

<p>Summary : The Martyr is the second novel in The Covenant of Steel, a new epic fantasy series of action, intrigue and magic from Anthony Ryan, a master storyteller who has taken the fantasy world by storm.Times have changed for Alwyn Scribe. Once an outlaw, he?s now a spymaster and sworn protector of Lady Evadine Courlain, whose visions of a demonic apocalypse have earned her the fanatical devotion of the faithful. Yet Evadine?s growing fame has put her at odds with both Crown and Covenant. As trouble brews in the kingdom, both seek to exploit her position for their own ends. Sent to the Duchy of Alundia to put down a rebellion, Alwyn must rely on old instincts to fight for his new cause. Deadly feuds and ancient secrets are laid bare as war erupts, a war that will decide the fate of the Kingdom of Albermaine and, perhaps, prevent the coming of the prophesied Second Scourge.</p>

<p>Summary : A disaster waiting to happen &#8211; or the start of something incredible?Abby Abernathy is a good girl. She doesn&#8217;t drink or swear and she works hard. Abby believes she has created enough distance between her and the darkness of her past, but when she arrives at college, her path to a new beginning is quickly challenged by the university&#8217;s walking one-night stand. Travis Maddox, handsome, built, and covered in tattoos, is exactly what Abby needs &#8211; and wants &#8211; to avoid. He spends his nights winning money in a floating fight ring, and his days as the notorious college Lothario.Intrigued by Abby&#8217;s resistance to his charms, Travis tricks her into his life with a simple bet. If he loses, he must remain celibate for a month. If Abby loses, she must live in Travis&#8217; apartment for the same amount of time.Either way, Travis has no idea that he has met his match. Or that this is the start of an obsessive, intense relationship that will lead them both into unimaginable territory?</p>

<p>Summary : Comparative Concepts of Criminal Law is unique in the sense that it introduces the reader to the fundamental concepts and rules of substantive criminal law in a comparative way and not just to the criminal law system of one specific jurisdiction. Compared with other fields of law, like contract and property law, comparative research into the so-called general part of criminal law is quite a recent phenomenon within academia. The increasing &#8216;Europeanisation&#8217; of criminal law and policy makes such a comparative approach even more necessary. This handbook therefore fills a legal educational gap by exploring basic concepts of substantive criminal law in three major European legal systems: the common law system of England and Wales and the civil law systems of Germany and the Netherlands. Each chapter focuses on a specific concept or doctrine that is necessary to determine criminal liability (e.g. actus reus, mens rea, defences, inchoate offences). Throughout the book the authors also </p>

<p>Summary : When Mitch McDeere signed on with Bendini, Lambert &amp; Locke of Memphis, he thought that he and his beautiful wife, Abby, were on their way. The firm leased him a BMW, paid off his school loans, arranged a mortgage, and hired the McDeeres a decorator. Mitch should have remembered what his brother Ray?doing fifteen years in a Tennessee jail?already knew: You never get nothing for nothing. Now the FBI has the lowdown on Mitch?s firm and needs his help. Mitch is caught between a rock and a hard place, with no choice?if he wants to live.</p>

<p>Summary : Do you want readers to be so caught up in your book that they forget they?re reading? Then you need deep POV.Deep POV takes the reader and places them inside of our characters?hearing their thoughts, feeling their emotions, and living the story through them. Compared to other writing styles, it builds a stronger emotional connection between the reader and our characters, creates the feeling of a faster pace, and helps avoid point-of-view errors and telling rather than showing.In Deep Point of View, writing instructor and fiction editor Marcy Kennedy brings her years of experience into showing you how to write deep POV. You?ll learn specific, practical things you can do immediately to take your fiction to the next level.Each book in the Busy Writer?s Guide series is intended to give you enough theory so that you can understand why things work and why they don?t, but also enough examples to see how that theory looks in practice. In addition, they provide tips and exercises to help you </p>

<p>Summary : I?m not a decent guy.I don?t do commitment.Women know the score before they land in my bed.But there is something about this feisty tattoo artist. She makes my blood boil. But with that pure, unadulterated rage comes an ache deep inside I simply can?t ignore.I despise her.I shouldn?t want her.The problem is?every part of me does.And it?s a complication I can no longer ignore.With threats against the club from our persistent rivals, it?s becoming clear we can?t be sure who to trust. As the saying goes? keep your friends close and your enemies closer.But without knowing, I?ve invited mine right in, and I?m falling for her hard.And when we hit the ground, I know it?s gonna hurt!From USA Today Bestselling Author K E Osborn comes the eagerly awaited first book in the NOLA Defiance MC Series.</p>

Featuring more than 100 profiles of pioneering women designers, some who have achieved global recognition such as Ray Eames, Charlotte Perriand and Zaha Hadid, it also introduces the fascinating and often untold stories of lesser?known designers, who have similarly shaped and enriched the story of design.

<p>Summary : It has been suggested that a species comes of age, not when its members have mastered intergalactic travel, but when they understand the reasons for their own existence. Thanks to Darwin, Mendel, and their disciples we can focus a scientific lens on human nature and begin to explain why humans are the way they are. Using readings from a range of professional and popular sources, the anthology &#8220;Human Evolution: Processes and Adaptations&#8221; develops the theory and methods of the modern evolutionist; then it applies this tool kit in an effort not merely to describe but also to explain the biological traits that define our species. The book links scientific articles with carefully tailored introductions, making cutting-edge research accessible to beginning students. Topics addressed in the book include: Natural Selection, Genetics, and Adaptation; Studying Adaptation; Speciation and Classification; Evolution and Spread of Ancestral Humans; Ecology and Diet: Past and Present; Evolution of </p>

<p>Summary : The Companion is an essential, interdisciplinary tool for those both familiar and unfamiliar with Wagner&#8217;s Ring. It opens with a concise introduction to both the composer and the Ring, introducing Wagner as a cultural figure, and giving a comprehensive overview of the work. Subsequent chapters, written by leading Wagner experts, focus on musical topics such as &#8216;leitmotif&#8217;, and structure, and provide a comprehensive set of character portraits, including leading players like Wotan, Br?nnhilde, and Siegfried. Further chapters look to the mythological background of the work and the idea of the Bayreuth Festival, as well as critical reception of the Ring, its relationship to Nazism, and its impact on literature and popular culture, in turn offering new approaches to interpretation including gender, race and environmentalism. The volume ends with a history of notable stage productions from the world premiere in 1876 to the most recent stagings in Bayreuth and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Summary : The Companion is an essential, interdisciplinary tool for those both familiar and unfamiliar with Wagner&#8217;s Ring. It opens with a concise introduction to both the composer and the Ring, introducing Wagner as a cultural figure, and giving a comprehensive overview of the work. Subsequent chapters, written by leading Wagner experts, focus on musical topics such as &#8216;leitmotif&#8217;, and structure, and provide a comprehensive set of character portraits, including leading players like Wotan, Br?nnhilde, and Siegfried. Further chapters look to the mythological background of the work and the idea of the Bayreuth Festival, as well as critical reception of the Ring, its relationship to Nazism, and its impact on literature and popular culture, in turn offering new approaches to interpretation including gender, race and environmentalism. The volume ends with a history of notable stage productions from the world premiere in 1876 to the most recent stagings in Bayreuth and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Summary : Okay, so at least you&#8217;re interested enough to pick up this book and look inside. I think you and I are going to get along just fine. Life is full of choices. Right now, yours is whether or not to buy the autobiography of a mid-grade, kind of hammy actor. &#8220;Am I supposed to know this guy? you think to yourself. No, and that&#8217;s exactly the point. Bookstores are chock full of household name actors and their high stakes shenanigans. I don&#8217;t want to be a spoilsport, but we&#8217;ve all been down that road before. Case in point: look to your left &#8211; see that Judy Garland book? You don&#8217;t need that, you know plenty about her already &#8211; great voice, crappy life. Now look to your right at the Charlton Heston book. You don&#8217;t need to cough up hard-earned dough for that either. You know his story too &#8211; great voice, crappy toupee. The truth is that though you might not have a clue who I am, there are countless working stiffs like me out there, grinding away every day at the wheel of fortune. &#8220;If Chins Could </p>

You don&amp;#8217;t need that, you know plenty about her already &amp;#8211; great voice, crappy life. Now look to your right at the Charlton Heston book. You don&amp;#8217;t need to cough up hard-earned dough for that either. You know his story too &amp;#8211; great voice, crappy toupee. The truth is that though you might not have a clue who I am, there are countless working stiffs like me out there, grinding away every day at the wheel of fortune. &amp;#8220;If Chins Could Discover the Bestseller Everyone is Talking About: Read If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor PDF , Reading If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor pdf , If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor Handbook , If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor read , If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor epub , If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor in English , If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor Kindle , If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor audiobook If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor Summary.

<p>Summary : Dopo la dissoluzione dell?URSS, il marxismo, in particolare in Occidente, ? entrato in una crisi che appare irreversibile. Per uscire da questa crisi ? che non ? un ?destino? ?, Domenico Losurdo, fuori da ogni intento apologetico, articola in questo libro un bilancio storico-filosofico dell?esperienza sovietica e del marxismo nel suo complesso. Ma Losurdo compie anche un passo ulteriore: osserva il marxismo per individuare ci? che esso ? capace di costruire in un futuro pi? o meno lontano.</p>

<p>Summary : In the aftermath of World War I, a naive woman is swept into a glittering world filled with dark magic, romance, and murder in this lush and decadent debut.On Crow Island, people whisper, real magic lurks just below the surface.?Neither real magic nor faux magic interests Annie Mason. Not after it stole her future. She?s only on the island to settle her late father?s estate and, hopefully, reconnect with her long-absent best friend, Beatrice, who fled their dreary lives for a more glamorous one.?Yet Crow Island is brimming with temptation, and the biggest one may be her enigmatic new neighbor.?Mysterious and alluring, Emmeline Delacroix is a figure shadowed by rumors of witchcraft. And when Annie witnesses a confrontation between Bea and Emmeline at one of the island&#8217;s extravagant parties, she is drawn into a glittering, haunted world. A world where the boundaries of wickedness are tested, and the cost of illicit magic might be death.</p>

<p>Summary : Nya can?t remember the last time she felt safe.The rundown rental house didn?t seem so bad at first. But now, someone is stealing her food. Rattling her bedroom doorknob. Digging through her belongings.Each night brings more disturbing incidents. And each night, Nya is more convinced that it?s not an intruder. She suspects the culprit is hiding in plain sight: her peculiar roommate-of-necessity, Sidney.Nya can?t afford to live anywhere else. The horrible rental is her only option. In a few months, she?ll finish her final semester of college?and get the hell out of dodge. But to her horror, the sinister mind games are just the beginning. Before long, she?s forced to face the possibility that her physical safety may be at risk. Maybe even her life.The truth is more terrifying than Nya could have guessed. And as the situation spirals out of control, it?s suddenly clear that surviving the night may no longer be an option.</p>

<p>Summary : Two short novels, including the title story and Black Fairy Tale, plus a bonus short story. Summer is a simple story of a nine-year-old girl who dies while on summer vacation. While her youthful killers try to hide her body, she tells us the story&#8211;from the point of view of her dead body&#8211;of the childrens&#8217; attempt to get away with murder. Black Fairy Tale is classic J-horror: a young girl loses an eye in an accident, but receives a transplant. Now she can see again, astonishingly what she sees out of her new left eye is the experiences and memories of its previous owner. Its previous deceased owner.</p>

Complex and fascinating chemical and biological processes are taking place in your mixing bowl and oven, thanks to wild yeast and bacteria, and the natural sugars, enzymes, and proteins found in flour.

Recipes are delectable, doable, and dependable?from a Rustic Boule to Wild Challah to Hazelnut Buns? teaching you the hows and whys of bread making along the way.Sourdough by Science has the answers to an array of sourdough questions: What is a sourdough starter?

<p>Summary : Born in a Mission in China, Lucy Waring finds herself with fifteen small children to feed and care for. The way she tackles this task leads to her being thrown into the grim prison of Chengfu, where she meets Nicholas Sabine &#8211; a man about to die.He asks her a cryptic riddle, the mystery of which echoes through all that befalls her in the months that follow&#8230;She is brought to England and tries to make a new life with the Gresham family, but she is constantly in disgrace and is soon involved in the bitter feud between the Greshams and a neighbouring family.There is danger, romance and heartache for Lucy as strange events build to a point where she begins to doubt her own senses.How could she see a man, long dead, walking in the misty darkness of the valley? And who carried her, unconscious, into the labyrinth of Chiselhurst Caves and left her to die?It is not until she returns to China that Lucy finds, amid high adventure, the answer to all that has baffled her.</p>

<p>Summary : Newly revised for its twelfth edition, <br />
  DeGarmo&#8217;s Materials and Processes in Manufacturing, <br />
12th Edition continues to be a market-leading text on manufacturing and manufacturing processes courses for over fifty years. Authors J T. Black and Ron Kohser have continued this book&#8217;s long and distinguished tradition of exceedingly clear presentation and highly practical approach to materials and processes, presenting mathematical models and analytical equations only when they enhance the basic understanding of the material. Updated to reflect all current practices, standards, and materials, the twelfth edition has new coverage of additive manufacturing, lean engineering, and processes related to ceramics, polymers, and plastics.</p>

<p>Summary : Founded in 1904 by representatives of the sporting organisations of six European nations then expanding into the Americas, Asia and Africa FIFA has developed to become one of the most high profile and lucrative businesses in the global consumer and cultural industry. Recent years however have been characterised by a series of crises leaving the organisation open to critique and exposure, and creating a soap operatic narrative of increasing interest to the global media.In this critical new account of one of the world&#8217;s most important sporting institutions, Professor Alan Tomlinson investigates the history of FIFA and the underlying political dynamics characterising its growth. The book explores the influence of the men who have led FIFA, the emergence of the World Cup as FIFA&#8217;s exclusive product, FIFA&#8217;s relationships with other federations and associations, the crises that have shaped its recent history, and the issues and challenges that are likely to shape its future.

<p>Summary : Scores are dead or injured. But who was the killer?s true target?On a misty morning in the Lake District, two men depart by helicopter from a private estate. Below, they see the stunning views of Wast Water, with Scafell Pike ahead, where fell runners are competing atop England?s highest mountain. It?s at this moment that the pilots lose control, and crash into the mountain top. Runners and bystanders are caught in the devastation.This is the scene that greets DI Kelly Porter. She attempts to coordinate the rescue efforts, though it?s clear many won?t make it, including occupants of the helicopter. Three are dead, and the fourth is badly injured. When it emerges that the survivor is none other than the Right Honourable Lord Donald Reilly, and the person who charted the flight was notorious billionaire Bartholomew Kennedy-Craig, the media frenzy is intense. Reilly is high up in government and his contact with the magnate provokes speculation. When it is learned that the helicopter had </p>

And even though she&#8217;s hardly spoken with them for a year, Sara finds herself deep in the darkness of the forest, her friends?and their cameras?following her down </p>

<p>Summary : About a millennium ago, in Cairo, an unknown author completed a large and richly illustrated book. In the course of thirty-five chapters, this book guided the reader on a journey from the outermost cosmos and planets to Earth and its lands, islands, features, and inhabitants. This treatise, known as The Book of Curiosities, was unknown to modern scholars until a remarkable manuscript copy surfaced in 2000.Lost Maps of the Caliphs provides the first general overview of The Book of Curiosities and the unique insight it offers into medieval Islamic thought. Opening with an account of the remarkable discovery of the manuscript and its purchase by the Bodleian Library, the authors use The Book of Curiosities to re-evaluate the development of astrology, geography, and cartography in the first four centuries of Islam. Their account assesses the transmission of Late Antique geography to the Islamic world, unearths the logic behind abstract maritime diagrams, and considers the palaces and </p>

<p>Summary : The Natural Order of Money is about the intrinsic relationship between people, money, and nature. The book begins by asking a simple question: Why do we in our modern society expect food as if it were a given? What initially makes cooperation between the farmer and other members of society possible, and what, in the long run, renders it sustainable? The proposed solution affirms the vital importance of the farmer and the food that he harvests and argues that only a natural money can serve as the concrete means of assuring ecological accountability and sustainable prosperity. In a time of uncertainty plagued by wealth inequality, inflation, and environmental stress, The Natural Order of Money pierces the fog of financial elitism and re-establishes society in our shared home of nature. It equips the reader with a compass to again find True North in a sea of economic confusion.The Natural Order of Money is written to be accessible to any reader while also engaging experts in the realm </p>

<p>Summary : (Available on Amazon) Quantum physics has revealed that objects can exist in more than one location simultaneously, even though the objects are invisible to us in all but one location, that is, parallel universes exist. This is most blatantly revealed in the mind shattering &#8216;double-slit&#8217; experiment and is at the core of what is called &#8216;the measurement problem,&#8217; in quantum physics. The results are startling, but this is what the science is clearly showing. It is human awareness that causes matter to fix into a single position, and reveal a single reality. The science is showing that at every moment we become aware of our reality, the universe splits into unseen parallel dimensions and we become trapped in just one of these many parallel realities. This is all powerful stuff but what does this mean for our lives? What if you could learn how to access these parallel worlds that are being created? What if you could do what many billionaires and great minds in history have done but have </p>

As it often happens with national heroes, Kutuzov gradually became larger than life, a messianic character who led Holy Russia against the evils of the Revolution and anarchy; the Soviet leaders later exploited hispersonality for even more grandiose schemes.The real Kutuzov was gradually replaced by a mythical character who appeared at a time of great danger to save Russia.

<p>Summary : A high-octane polemic against cars?which are ruining the world, while making us unhappy and unhealthy?from a talented young writer at the Economist The automobile was one of the most miraculous inventions of the 20th century. It promised freedom, style, and utility. But sometimes, rather than improving our lives technology just makes everything worse. Over the past century cars have filled the air with toxic pollutants and fueled climate change. Cars have stolen public space and made our cities uglier, dirtier, less useful, and more unequal. Cars have caused tens of millions of deaths and injuries. They have wasted our time and our money. In Carmageddon, journalist Daniel Knowles outlines the rise of the automobile and the costs we all bear as a result. Weaving together history, economics, and reportage, Knowles traces the forces and decisions that normalized cars and cemented our reliance on them. He takes readers around the world to show the ways car use has impacted people?s </p>

<p>Summary : Some say the river drowned her&#8230;Some say it brought her back to life.On a dark midwinter?s night in an ancient inn on the Thames, the regulars are entertaining themselves by telling stories when the door bursts open and in steps an injured stranger. In his arms is the drowned corpse of a child.Hours later, the dead girl stirs, takes a breath and returns to life.Is it a miracle?Is it magic?And who does the little girl belong to?An exquisitely crafted multi-layered mystery brimming with folklore, suspense and romance, as well as with the urgent scientific curiosity of the Darwinian age, Once Upon a River is as richly atmospheric as Setterfield?s bestseller The Thirteenth Tale.</p>

<p>Summary : Paul?s letter to the Roman church is one of the most widely read, rigorously discussed and minutely dissected epistles ever written. What more could there be to say?Plenty, it turns out.In this highly engaging, perceptive and accessible commentary, J. R. Daniel Kirk situates Romans firmly in its first-century context, redirecting our attention from a modern-day concern with individual salvation towards the theological questions that consumed the apostle Paul. Questions such as what are the Jews and Gentiles to make of one another? Practically, how are they to live, worship and be community together in the right here and now? And, most importantly for Paul, how can God be faithful if God?s great act of salvation excludes God?s own chosen the covenantal community to whom all promises had been made?By approaching the text from a first-century perspective, Kirk illuminates a letter and its writer deeply concerned with the day-to-day lives of its readers. A letter written not to provide </p>

He was Arthur, Pendragon of the Island of the Mighty?who would rise to legendary greatness in a Britain torn by violence, greed and war; the Lord of Summer who would usher in a glorious reign of peace and prosperity . . . and whose noble, trusting heart would be broken by treachery.</p>

<p>Summary : An immersive, gripping account of the rise and fall of Iran&#8217;s glamorous Pahlavi dynasty, written with the cooperation of the late Shah&#8217;s widow, Empress Farah, Iranian revolutionaries and US officials from the Carter administration.In this remarkably human portrait of one of the twentieth century&#8217;s most complicated personalities, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Andrew Scott Cooper traces the Shah&#8217;s life from childhood through his ascension to the throne in 1941. He draws the turbulence of the post-war era during which the Shah survived assassination attempts and coup plots to build a modern, pro-Western state and launch Iran onto the world stage as one of the world&#8217;s top five powers.Readers get the story of the Shah&#8217;s political career alongside the story of his courtship and marriage to Farah Diba, who became a power in her own right, the beloved family they created, and an exclusive look at life inside the palace during the Iranian Revolution. Cooper&#8217;s investigative account ultimately </p>

<p>Summary : Set mostly in Arizona and L.A., Drive is about a man who does stunt driving for movies by day and drives for criminals at night. Sallis combines murder, treachery and payback in a sinister plot with resonances of 1940s pulp fiction and film noir. Told through a cinematic narrative that weaves back and forth through time and place, the story explores Driver&#8217;s near existential moral foundations, intercut with moments of bloody violence.</p>

<p>Summary : Two missing girls. Thirteen years apart.Olivia Shaw has been missing since last Tuesday. She was last seen outside the entrance of her elementary school in Hunts Point wearing a white spring jacket, blue jeans, and pink boots. I force myself to look at the face in the photo, into her slightly smudged features, and I can&#8217;t bring myself to move. Olivia Shaw could be my mirror image, rewound to thirteen years ago. If you have any knowledge of Olivia Shaw&#8217;s whereabouts or any relevant information, please contact&#8230; I&#8217;ve spent a long time peering into the faces of girls on missing posters, wondering which one replaced me in that basement. But they were never quite the right age, the right look, the right circumstances. Until Olivia Shaw, missing for one week tomorrow. Whoever stole me was never found. But since I was taken, there hasn&#8217;t been another girl. And now there is.</p>

<p>Summary : Now in its third edition, this authoritative guide covers all of the core aspects of maritime law in one distinct volume. &#8220;Maritime Law&#8221; is written by a team of leading academics and practitioners, each expert in their own field. Together, they provide clear, concise and fully up-to-date coverage of topics ranging from bills of lading to arrest of ships, all written in an accessible and engaging style. As English law is heavily relied on throughout the maritime world, this book is grounded in English law whilst continuing to analyse the key international conventions currently in force.Brand new coverage includes:Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (recast)The coming into force of the 2006 Maritime Labour Convention and the Merchant Shipping Regulations 2014The approval of the 2012 edition of the Norwegian Sale FormRegulation </p>

<p>Summary : Book 3 of Brutal Kings SeriesI?ve fallen in love? ?with a monster. What?s a girl to do?He?s a monsterBut I love himI thought he loved meI thought wrong? In the bedroom, he?s my hero. Out of bed, he?s distant, cruel, and only warm enough to keep people from whispering. I thought I?d found a softer side of him. Maybe I was wrong. Over a family holiday, my feelings for him become undeniably strong and I?d swear he felt the same way. But he says he doesn?t love me. And he?s pushing me away. My heart is breaking because the man I?d thought was a villain seemed like my savior for a moment. Now I know the truth; he?s never going to love me and my heart might not survive him.

La notevole quantit? di nozioni basilari richiede un criterio selettivo di ordine funzionale e sperimentato; di qui la scelta di proporre una ripartizione classica, per rendere disponibile un grande contenitore di concetti essenziali. L?ordine seguito e il linguaggio, volutamente piano e didascalico, intendono agevolare il lettore nella costruzione di proprie mappe e reti concettuali, per ordinare e sistematizzare le acquisizioni in un apprendimento significativo, che consenta di utilizzarle per affrontare ipotesi di soluzione </p>

<p>Summary : At the turn of the twentieth century, Ellen Rimbauer became the young bride of Seattle industrialist John Rimbauer, and began keeping a remarkable diary. This diary became the secret place where Ellen could confess her fears of the new marriage, her confusion over her emerging sexuality, and the nightmare that her life would become. The diary not only follows the development of a girl into womanhood, it follows the construction of the Rimbauer mansioncalled Rose Redan enormous home that would be the site of so many horrific and inexplicable tragedies in the years ahead. The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer: My Life at Rose Red is a rare document, one that gives us an unusual view of daily life among the aristocracy in the early 1900s, a window into one womans hidden emotional torment, and a record of the mysterious events at Rose Red that scandalized Seattle society at the timeevents that can only be fully understood now that the diary has come to light. Edited by Joyce Reardon, Ph.D. as part </p>
