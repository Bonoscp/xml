<p>Summary : &#8220;For anyone who gets high on language, this book is a fantastic trip&#8230;a real tour de force.&#8221;?Madison Smartt Bell, SpinThe acclaimed author of the cult classics Trainspotting and The Acid House, Irvine Welsh has been hailed as &#8220;the best thing that has happened to British writing in a decade&#8221; (London Sunday Times ). This audacious novel is a brilliant (and literal) head trip of a book that brings us into the wildly active, albeit coma-beset, mind of Roy Strang, whose hallucinatory quest to eradicate the evil predator/scavenger marabou stork keeps being interrupted by grisly memories of the social and family dysfunction that brought him to this state. It is the sort of lethally funny cocktail of pathos, violence, and outrageous hilarity that only Irvine Welsh can pull off.</p>

<p>Summary : An eye-opening exploration of power and how we can harness it using performance techniques borrowed from actors.What if instead of worrying about getting more power, we focus on using the power we do have better?Stanford business professor Deborah Gruenfeld combines 25 years of social psychology research with personal experience to reveal the truth about power: that we all have more than we realise and what counts is what we do with it.Acting with Power shows anyone seeking greater professional and academic success what power is actually for, how to identify it within ourselves, and how to use it constructively using acting techniques.Some of us crave a bigger role, and many of us feel like imposters in our current ones. Acting with Power shows us how to be the best version of ourselves in any role, on any stage.</p>

<p>Summary : Bristal, an orphaned kitchen maid, lands in a gritty fairy tale gone wrong when she discovers she is an elicromancer with a knack for shape-shifting. An ancient breed of immortal magic beings, elicromancers have been winnowed down to merely two &#8211; now three &#8211; after centuries of bloody conflict in the realm. Their gifts are fraught with responsibility, and sixteen-year-old Bristal is torn between two paths. Should she vow to seek the good of the world, to protect and serve mortals? Or should she follow the strength of her power, even if it leads to unknown terrors? She draws on her ability to disguise herself as a man to infiltrate a prince&#8217;s band of soldiers, and masquerades as a fairy godmother to shield a cursed princess, but time is running out. As an army of dark creatures grows closer, Bristal faces a supernatural war. To save the kingdoms, Bristal must find the courage to show her true form.Building on homages to?Cinderella,?Sleeping Beauty, Jane Austen?s?Emma?and the Chinese </p>

As Ben and Nathan&#8217;s friendship grows, their feelings for each other begin to change, and what started as a disastrous turn of events looks like it might just be a chance to start a happier new life.At turns heartbreaking and joyous, I Wish You All the Best is both a celebration of life, friendship, and love, and a shining example of hope in the face of adversity.</p>

Two years later, fed up with soap-eating rats, stolen human hearts and the creepy colonel across the road, they returned to England with a bitter taste in their mouths. Twenty years later, Monisha came back. Taking a page out of Jules Verne&#8217;s classic tale, Around the World in 80 Days, she embarked on a 40,000km adventure around India in 80 trains.

<p>Summary : Rush is a Fae Guardian, a wolf-shifter whose enhanced abilities have made him a ruthless protector of Elphyne. His job is to protect the realm from the human enemy, and to ensure the sins of the past never come to pass again lest magic die forever. But one night of weakness resulted in a curse worse than death &#8211; exile. Now he spends his lonely time longing to be part of the living, once again protecting them from monsters&#8230; until one mysteriously washes up on the shores of his lake.Clarke is human. She&#8217;s beautiful, feisty, and fierce. She&#8217;s also the only person who can see him, speak to him, and touch him. If he hands her over to the Order, she&#8217;s his ticket to having his curse removed. Unable to resist the opportunity, he tricks her into a bargain of obedience, never once suspecting his world is about to be turned upside down. The more he learns about this human enemy, the more he realizes she&#8217;s not the monster he&#8217;s been trained to believe. In fact, she&#8217;s capable of inciting passion </p>

<p>Summary : You should never judge how someone chooses to raise their child.Elizabeth and Bryony are polar opposites but their unexpected friendship has always worked. They&#8217;re the best of friends, and godmothers to each other&#8217;s daughters &#8211; because they trust that the safety of their children is both of their top priority.But what if their choice could harm your own child?Little do they know that they differ radically over one very important issue. And when Bryony, afraid of being judged, tells what is supposed to be a harmless white lie before a child&#8217;s birthday party, the consequences are more catastrophic than either of them could ever have imagined . . . **** <br />
  &#8216;Gripping, thought-provoking, moving and oh-so-topical, THE HERD tackles the most divisive parenting issue of our age with skill and compassion. Fans of Jodi Picoult will DEVOUR it&#8217; Tammy Cohen</p>

<p>Summary : Best friends Lindsey, Kendra, and Dani endure every parent&#8217;s nightmare when a tragic accident befalls their teenage boys, leaving one dead, another in a coma, and a third too traumatized to speak. Reeling from the worst night of their lives, the three mothers plunge into a desperate investigation of the bizarre incident. How could something so horrible happen in their wealthy Southern California suburb? They soon discover that the accident was just the beginning, and troubling discoveries lead to chilling questions: Do they really know their children? Do they even know each other? As more secrets surface, a fog of doubt and suspicion threatens to poison their families, their friendships, and the whole community. With the illusion of happiness and safety long gone, these women must now confront the hazards of heartbreak, the consequences of jealousy, and the dangers of living double lives.</p>

<p>Summary : Best friends Lindsey, Kendra, and Dani endure every parent&#8217;s nightmare when a tragic accident befalls their teenage boys, leaving one dead, another in a coma, and a third too traumatized to speak. Reeling from the worst night of their lives, the three mothers plunge into a desperate investigation of the bizarre incident. How could something so horrible happen in their wealthy Southern California suburb? They soon discover that the accident was just the beginning, and troubling discoveries lead to chilling questions: Do they really know their children? Do they even know each other? As more secrets surface, a fog of doubt and suspicion threatens to poison their families, their friendships, and the whole community. With the illusion of happiness and safety long gone, these women must now confront the hazards of heartbreak, the consequences of jealousy, and the dangers of living double lives.</p>

<p>Summary : During the early twentieth century, a diverse group of African American women carved out unique niches for themselves within New York City&#8217;s expansive informal economy. LaShawn Harris illuminates the labor patterns and economic activity of three perennials within this kaleidoscope of underground industry: sex work, numbers running for gambling enterprises, and the supernatural consulting business. Mining police and prison records, newspaper accounts, and period literature, Harris teases out answers to essential questions about these women and their working lives. She also offers a surprising revelation, arguing that the burgeoning underground economy served as a catalyst in working-class black women&#8217;s creation of the employment opportunities, occupational identities, and survival strategies that provided them with financial stability and a sense of labor autonomy and mobility. At the same time, urban black women, all striving for economic and social prospects and pleasures, </p>

<p>Summary : From before the dawn of the twentieth century until the arrival of the New Deal, one of the most protracted and deadly labor struggles in American history was waged in West Virginia. On one side were powerful corporations and industrialists whose millions bought political influence and armed guards for their company towns. On the other side were 50,000 mine workers, the nation?s largest labor union, and the legendary ?miners? angel,? Mother Jones. Attempts to unionize were met with stiff resistance. Fundamental rights were bent, then broken, and the violence evolved from bloody skirmishes to open armed conflict. The fight for civil rights and unionization in West Virginia verged on civil war and stretched from the creeks and hollows to the courts and the U.S. Senate. In The Devil Is Here in These Hills, celebrated labor historian James Green tells this story like never before.</p>

<p>Summary : From before the dawn of the twentieth century until the arrival of the New Deal, one of the most protracted and deadly labor struggles in American history was waged in West Virginia. On one side were powerful corporations and industrialists whose millions bought political influence and armed guards for their company towns. On the other side were 50,000 mine workers, the nation?s largest labor union, and the legendary ?miners? angel,? Mother Jones. Attempts to unionize were met with stiff resistance. Fundamental rights were bent, then broken, and the violence evolved from bloody skirmishes to open armed conflict. The fight for civil rights and unionization in West Virginia verged on civil war and stretched from the creeks and hollows to the courts and the U.S. Senate.

<p>Summary : &#8220;Many people have written about creativity, but although they were very, very clever, they weren&#8217;t actually creative. I like to think I&#8217;m writing about it from the inside.&#8221; &#8211;John CleeseCreativity is usually regarded as a mysterious, rare gift that only a few possess. John Cleese begs to differ, and in this short, immensely practical, and often very amusing guide he shows it&#8217;s a skill that anyone can acquire. Drawing on his lifelong experience as a writer, he shares his insights into the nature of the creative process and offers advice on how to get your own inventive juices flowing. What do you need to do to get yourself in the right frame of mind? When do you know that you&#8217;ve come up with something that might be worth pursuing? What do you do if you think you&#8217;ve hit a brick wall?Not only does he explain the way your mind works as you search for inspiration, he also shows that, regardless of the task you&#8217;ve set yourself, you can learn to be better at coming up with a promising idea, </p>

<p>Summary : Los mundos de Gald?s y Cervantes, la herida republicana, las novelas de un joven narrador y los cuadernos de Carmen Mart?n Gaite, las reflexiones de Raffaele La Capria, y siempre Max Aub, componen un fresco donde imperan el conocimiento y la dial?ctica de la sospecha. Chirbes articula con este libro el tr?nsito que se establece en el tiempo cuando el futuro se busca en el pasado y el ayer revela las simas del porvenir. Un intenso viaje de ida y vuelta, d?nde se destaca a autores, novelas y asuntos que han ocupado un espacio remarcable dentro de su propia trastienda.De manera especial, dos calas que muestran a un narrador que remueve certezas propias y ajenas. La indagaci?n sobre La Celestina nos descubre las tensiones de un discurso que se nutre y destroza los discursos de su tiempo, y el recorrido por las novelas y escritores de la guerra (Homero, Barbuse o Karl Kraus) explica algunas claves de Crematorio, su novela aparecida en 2007.</p>

<p>Summary : Griffin Tomlin is dead. And Clara?s sister killed him . . . Four months after the murder, the entire town of Shiloh is still in shock. For Clara Porterfield, the normal world has crumbled around her in a million chaotic pieces. Now Clara lives in a new reality, where her sister awaits trial for murder, her mother obsessively digs in a dead, frozen garden, and her father lives and breathes denial. At school, Clara is haunted by her classmates&#8217; morbid curiosity?and all of the unspoken questions they won?t ask. But none of them knows what she knows . . . Now Clara&#8217;s sister wants something from her?the one thing in all of this that Clara isn&#8217;t ready to face: the truth about what really happened that night. Because this story didn&#8217;t die with Griffin Tomlin. There&#8217;s another story that needs to be told. And sometimes, the lies we&#8217;re told are nowhere near as deadly as the lies we tell ourselves . . .</p>

And Clara?s sister killed him . . . Four months after the murder, the entire town of Shiloh is still in shock. For Clara Porterfield, the normal world has crumbled around her in a million chaotic pieces. Now Clara lives in a new reality, where her sister awaits trial for murder, her mother obsessively digs in a dead, frozen garden, and her father lives and breathes denial. At school, Clara is haunted by her classmates&amp;#8217; morbid curiosity?and all of the unspoken questions they won?t ask. But none of them knows what she knows . . . Now Clara&amp;#8217;s sister wants something from her?the one thing in all of this that Clara isn&amp;#8217;t ready to face: the truth about what really happened that night. Because this story didn&amp;#8217;t die with Griffin Tomlin. There&amp;#8217;s another story that needs to be told. And sometimes, the lies we&amp;#8217;re told are nowhere near as deadly as the lies we tell ourselves . . .

<p>Summary : Innocent!That final verdict came after George Cardinal Pell endured a grueling eight years of accusations, investigations, trials, public humiliations, and more than a year of imprisonment after being convicted by an Australian court of a crime he did not commit. Led off to jail in handcuffs, following his sentencing on March 13, 2019, the 78-year-old Australian prelate began what was meant to be six years in jail for &#8220;historical sexual assault offenses?. Cardinal Pell endured more than thirteen months in solitary confinement, before the Australian High Court voted 7-0 to overturn his original convictions. His victory over injustice was not just personal, but one for the entire Catholic Church.Bearing no ill will toward his accusers, judges, prison workers, journalists, and those harboring and expressing hatred for him, the cardinal used his time in prison as a kind of &#8220;extended retreat&#8221;. He eloquently filled notebook pages with his spiritual insights, prison experiences, and </p>

<p>Summary : The prize-winning debut mystery from one of Japan&#8217;s best-loved crime writers.The K Apartments for Ladies are occupied by over one hundred unmarried women, once young and lively, now grown and old&#8211;and in some cases, evil.Their residence conceals a secret connecting the unsolved 1951 kidnapping of four-year-old George Kraft to the clandestine burial of a child&#8217;s body in the basement bath-house. So, when news comes that the building must be moved to make way for a road-building project, more than one tenant waits with apprehension for the grisly revelation that will follow. Then the master key is lost, stolen and re-stolen&#8211;and suddenly no-one feels safe.Fiendish intrigue, double identity and an ingenious plot make this a thriller worthy of comparison with the work of P.D. James.</p>

So, when news comes that the building must be moved to make way for a road-building project, more than one tenant waits with apprehension for the grisly revelation that will follow. Then the master key is lost, stolen and re-stolen&#8211;and suddenly no-one feels safe.Fiendish intrigue, double identity and an ingenious plot make this a thriller worthy of comparison with the work of P.D. James.</p>

<p>Summary : Gideon: Your weakness. God&#8217;s strength. is a 7 session women&#8217;s Bible study by Priscilla Shirer. When we hear the name Gideon, most of us think about his 300 soldiers or the fleece he laid out under the evening sky. But Gideon&#8217;s story is so much bigger than thatbigger than any one man and his mark on Israel&#8217;s history. Like everything else in the Bible, this is a story about God and His people. His love for them, as well as His strength operating in spite of their weaknesseven through their weakness. And because God&#8217;s people includes you and me, Gideon&#8217;s story is also about usour lives, our doubts, our struggles, and our possibilities as believers. From a state of fear, weakness, and insecurity, Gideon emerged as Israel&#8217;s hero, filled with God&#8217;s presence and His passion for deliverance. This study will encourage you to recognize your weakness as the key that the Lord gives you to unlock the full experience of His strength in your life. In what ways do you feel insufficient? Those places </p>

<p>Summary : In this accessible and engaging book, Dr.Patricia Papernow brings four decades of clinical experience and research findings to describing the five unique challenges of &#8220;blended families.&#8221; Dr.Papernow&#8217;s wisdom, intelligence, and good humor shine throughout as she follows a dozen very different stepfamilies. She provides tools to meet their challenges on three different levels&#8211;psychoeducation (a wealth of concrete information about what works and what doesn&#8217;t), interpersonal skills (including a &#8220;tool box&#8221; of effective skills), and, where needed, intrapsychic work (rich examples of healing old family-of-origin bruises that were intensifying the challenges). Already being called &#8220;an instant classic,&#8221; this book is an indispensable and highly readable guide for both stepfamily members and for those who want to help.</p>

A trav?s d?una ?mplia varietat de temes, explora el fet narratiu com una necessitat humana, i al capdavall escriu, ben camuflada, una carta d?amor a la literatura mateixa. Rushdie explica qu? significa per a ell l?obra d?autors que van des de Shakespeare i Cervantes fins a Samuel Beckett, Eudora Welty i Toni Morrison. S?endinsa en la naturalesa de la veritat, es delecta en la vibrant mal?leabilitat del llenguatge i les l?nies creatives que poden unir l?art i la vida, i reflexiona sobre la migraci? i el multiculturalisme, la llibertat d?expressi? i la censura. En un per?ode de canvis culturals transcendentals, Els llenguatges de la veritat ?s l?obra necess?ria del Rushdie m?s l?cid, un pensador original i comprom?s que enlluerna tant en la seva an?lisi </p>

<p>Summary : Lush and frothy, incisive and witty, Shola von Reinhold?s decadent queer literary debut immerses readers in the pursuit of aesthetics and beauty, while interrogating the removal and obscurement of Black figures from history.Solitary Mathilda has long been enamored with the ?Bright Young Things? of the 20s, and throughout her life, her attempts at reinvention have mirrored their extravagance and artfulness. After discovering a photograph of the forgotten Black modernist poet Hermia Druitt, who ran in the same circles as the Bright Young Things that she adores, Mathilda becomes transfixed and resolves to learn as much as she can about the mysterious figure. Her search brings her to a peculiar artists? residency in Dun, a small European town Hermia was known to have lived in during the 30s. The artists? residency throws her deeper into a lattice of secrets and secret societies that takes hold of her aesthetic imagination, but will she be able to break the thrall of her Transfixions?From </p>

<p>Summary : Nascosta tra le foreste della Pennsylvania, Catherine House ? una scuola d?eccellenza che ha sfornato premi Nobel, giudici della Corte suprema e personalit? di primo piano nel mondo dell?arte, della cultura e della politica. I suoi criteri di ammissione sono rigidissimi, e le poche persone che ogni anno superano la selezione avranno vitto, alloggio e istruzione gratuiti, ma per tre anni ? estati comprese ? saranno completamente tagliate fuori dal mondo esterno: niente visite, telefonate, televisione, musica&#8230; Alla fine, per?, avranno davanti a s? carriere brillanti, potere e prestigio in qualunque campo desiderino.Per Ines Murillo, Catherine House ? la cosa pi? vicina a una casa che abbia mai avuto. Ma i rigidi rituali della scuola presto trasformano l?edificio in una prigione tanto affascinante quanto ambigua. E quando scoppia la tragedia, Ines inizia a sospettare che l?istituto nasconda un pericoloso segreto.</p>

<p>Summary : The quest for perfection is exhausting and unrelenting. We spend too much precious time and energy managing perception and creating carefully edited versions of ourselves to show to the world. As hard as we try, we can&#8217;t seem to turn off the tapes that fill our heads with messages like, &#8216;Never good enough!&#8217; and &#8216;What will people think?&#8217; Why? What fuels this unattainable need to look like we always have it all together? At first glance we might think it&#8217;s because we admire perfection, but that&#8217;s not the case. We are actually the most attracted to people we consider to be authentic and down-to-earth. We love people who are &#8216;real&#8217; &#8211; we&#8217;re drawn to those who both embrace their imperfections and radiate self-acceptance. There is a constant barrage of social expectations that teach us that being imperfect is synonymous with being inadequate. Everywhere we turn, there are messages that tell us who, what and how we&#8217;re supposed to be. So, we learn to hide our struggles and protect ourselves </p>

<p>Summary : For Principles of Economics courses. Economics: Principles, Applications, and Tools, is also suitable for economists, financial analysts and other finance professionals.

Students come into their first Economics course thinking they will gain a better understanding of the economy around them. Unfortunately, they often leave with many unanswered questions. To ensure students actively internalize economics, O&#8217;Sullivan/Sheffrin/Perez use chapter-opening questions to spark interest on important economic concepts, applications that vividly illustrate those concepts, and chapter-ending tools that test and solidify understanding.</p>

<p>Summary : Emiko Amai is six years old in August 1945 when the Hiroshima bomb burns away half of her face. To Anton, a young German physicist involved in the Manhattan Project, that same bomb represents the pinnacle of scientific elegance. And for his Austrian wife Sophie, a Jewish refugee, it marks the start of an irreparable fissure in their new marriage. Fifty years later, seemingly far removed from the day that defined their lives, Emiko visits Anton and Sophie, and in Dennis Bock?s powerfully imagined narrative, their histories converge.</p>

<p>Summary : Winner of the Sustainability Science Award 2020, Ecological Society of America Winner of the PROSE Award (Biological Sciences category) 2020, Association of American PublishersThere is a growing crisis in our oceans: mysterious outbreaks of infectious disease are on the rise. Marine epidemics can cause mass die-offs of wildlife from the bottom to the top of food chains, impacting the health of ocean ecosystems as well as lives on land. Portending global environmental disaster, ocean outbreaks are fueled by warming seas, sewage dumping, unregulated aquaculture, and drifting plastic.Ocean Outbreak follows renowned scientist Drew Harvell and her colleagues into the field as they investigate how four iconic marine animals?corals, abalone, salmon, and starfish?have been devastated by disease. Based on over twenty years of research, this firsthand account of the sometimes gradual, sometimes exploding impact of disease on our ocean?s biodiversity ends with solutions and a call to action. </p>

<p>Summary : Winner of the Sustainability Science Award 2020, Ecological Society of America Winner of the PROSE Award (Biological Sciences category) 2020, Association of American PublishersThere is a growing crisis in our oceans: mysterious outbreaks of infectious disease are on the rise. Marine epidemics can cause mass die-offs of wildlife from the bottom to the top of food chains, impacting the health of ocean ecosystems as well as lives on land. Portending global environmental disaster, ocean outbreaks are fueled by warming seas, sewage dumping, unregulated aquaculture, and drifting plastic.Ocean Outbreak follows renowned scientist Drew Harvell and her colleagues into the field as they investigate how four iconic marine animals?corals, abalone, salmon, and starfish?have been devastated by disease. Based on over twenty years of research, this firsthand account of the sometimes gradual, sometimes exploding impact of disease on our ocean?s biodiversity ends with solutions and a call to action. </p>

La prova risalirebbe all?ottobre 2017, quando i telescopi sull?isola di Maui intercettarono un punto luminoso che sfrecciava rapido nel cielo. Si trattava del primo oggetto interstellare mai individuato nel nostro sistema solare, battezzato con il nome di ?Oumuamua.Alla luce dei dati raccolti in undici giorni di osservazione, gli scienziati si aggrapparono alla teoria che ?Oumuamua fosse una cometa piuttosto anomala, dato che aveva una forma stravagante, era troppo brillante, viaggiava a velocit? sostenuta lungo una traiettoria inusuale e non lasciava detriti al suo passaggio. Secondo l?approccio tanto visionario quanto rigoroso di Loeb, l?ipotesi migliore ? invece molto pi? semplice: ?Oumuamua non era un fenomeno naturale. Le sue caratteristiche peculiari indicherebbero una tecnologia extraterrestre molto avanzata. Ma la teoria sulle origini </p>

<p>Summary : A modern mafia fairytale.Born into one of the leading mob families in Chicago, Aria Scuderi is a mafia princess known for her beauty. What many consider a gift means her doom when she?s forced to marry Luca Vitiello to bring peace between two mafia dynasties. Luca is the future Capo of the New York Famiglia, a man known for his brutality?and for crushing his cousin?s throat with his bare hands.Aria is terrified of marrying a monster like him. He may be one of the most sought-after bachelors in New York, thanks to his good looks, wealth and predator-like charisma. But Aria knows the bad boy aura isn?t just a game; blood and death lurk beneath Luca?s striking gray eyes and arrogant smile.In her world a handsome exterior often hides the monster within; a monster who can just as easily kill as kiss you.Yet, there?s no escaping the arranged bond, much less a man like Luca. He?d follow her to the end of the world.Her only chance to survive in a marriage with Luca is to gain his affection </p>

They?ll make sure of that.While I do everything I can to navigate between the life I want and the growing threats around me, I find myself drawn to Beau, a hotter-than-sin alpha male, who struggles with problems of his own.With so many hurdles to cross and nowhere to run, will Beau and I see past our differences and secure our futures, or will the threats that are closing in on us lead to disaster??New from bestselling Discover the Bestseller Everyone is Talking About: Read Wolf&amp;#8217;s Rejection (Bobon Wolf Shifters #1) PDF , Reading Wolf&amp;#8217;s Rejection (Bobon Wolf Shifters #1) pdf , Wolf&amp;#8217;s Rejection (Bobon Wolf Shifters #1) Handbook , Wolf&amp;#8217;s Rejection (Bobon Wolf Shifters #1) read , Wolf&amp;#8217;s Rejection (Bobon Wolf Shifters #1) epub , Wolf&amp;#8217;s Rejection (Bobon Wolf Shifters #1) in English , Wolf&amp;#8217;s Rejection (Bobon Wolf Shifters #1) Kindle , Wolf&amp;#8217;s Rejection (Bobon Wolf Shifters #1) audiobook Wolf&amp;#8217;s Rejection (Bobon Wolf Shifters #1) Summary.

<p>Summary : In a sprawling bungalow on New Delhi&#8217;s posh Hailey Road, Justice Laxmi Narayan Thakur and his wife Mamta spend their days watching anxiously over their five beautiful (but troublesome) alphabetically named daughters. Anjini, married but an incorrigible flirt; Binodini, very worried about her children&#8217;s hissa in the family property; Chandrakanta, who eloped with a foreigner on the eve of her wedding; Eshwari, who is just a little too popular at Modern School, Barakhamba Road; and the Judge&#8217;s favourite (though fathers shouldn&#8217;t have favourites): the quietly fiery Debjani, champion of all the stray animals on Hailey Road, who reads the English news on DD and clashes constantly with crusading journalist Dylan Singh Shekhawat, he of shining professional credentials but tarnished personal reputation, crushingly dismissive of her state-sponsored propaganda, but always seeking her out with half-sarcastic, half-intrigued dark eyes.

<p>Summary : In a sprawling bungalow on New Delhi&#8217;s posh Hailey Road, Justice Laxmi Narayan Thakur and his wife Mamta spend their days watching anxiously over their five beautiful (but troublesome) alphabetically named daughters. Anjini, married but an incorrigible flirt; Binodini, very worried about her children&#8217;s hissa in the family property; Chandrakanta, who eloped with a foreigner on the eve of her wedding; Eshwari, who is just a little too popular at Modern School, Barakhamba Road; and the Judge&#8217;s favourite (though fathers shouldn&#8217;t have favourites): the quietly fiery Debjani, champion of all the stray animals on Hailey Road, who reads the English news on DD and clashes constantly with crusading journalist Dylan Singh Shekhawat, he of shining professional credentials but tarnished personal reputation, crushingly dismissive of her state-sponsored propaganda, but always seeking her out with half-sarcastic, half-intrigued dark eyes.

<p>Summary : By investigating a simple question, a philosopher of science and a molecular biologist offer an accessible understanding of microbial communities and a motivating theory for future research in community ecology. ? Microorganisms, such as bacteria, are important determinants of health at the individual, ecosystem, and global levels. And yet many aspects of modern life, from the overuse of antibiotics to chemical spills and climate change, can have devastating, lasting impacts on the communities formed by microorganisms. Drawing on the latest scientific research and real-life examples such as attempts to reengineer these communities through microbial transplantation, the construction of synthetic communities of microorganisms, and the use of probiotics, this book explores how and why communities of microorganisms respond to disturbance, and what might lead to failure. It also unpacks related and interwoven philosophical questions: What is an organism? Can a community evolve by natural </p>

Could there be a different way to relate to the world, one that would allow her to feel more rested and at ease, even as seismic changes unfold on the planet? Might there be a way for all of us to move through life with curiosity and tenderness, sensitized to the subtle magic all around?In Enchantment, May invites the reader to come with her on a journey to reawaken our innate sense of wonder and awe.

Una historia deliciosa que combina misterios y cocina y que triunfa en Jap?n y en todo el mundo Los misterios de la taberna Kamogawa es una de las novelas m?s apetitosas que vas a leer jam?s. Una historia llena de ternura sobre una pareja de detectives formada por el padre y la hija del Kamogawa Shokudo, un restaurante escondido en Kioto, que siempre est? lleno. El ?xito entre la clientela radica en que este d?o singular se ha especializado en preparar exactamente el plato que el p?blico anhela y recuerda de su pasado y no es capaz de reproducir o encontrar. Y lo hacen investigando la historia de la persona en cuesti?n.

Una historia deliciosa que combina misterios y cocina y que triunfa en Jap?n y en todo el mundo Los misterios de la taberna Kamogawa es una de las novelas m?s apetitosas que vas a leer jam?s.

<p>Summary : 10 hours A romance writer who no longer believes in love and a literary writer stuck in a rut engage in a summer-long challenge that may just upend everything they believe about happily ever afters.Augustus Everett is an acclaimed author of literary fiction. January Andrews writes bestselling romance. When she pens a happily ever after, he kills off his entire cast.They&#8217;re polar opposites.In fact, the only thing they have in common is that for the next three months, they&#8217;re living in neighboring beach houses, broke, and bogged down with writer&#8217;s block.Until, one hazy evening, one thing leads to another and they strike a deal designed to force them out of their creative ruts: Augustus will spend the summer writing something happy, and January will pen the next Great American Novel. She&#8217;ll take him on field trips worthy of any rom-com montage, and he&#8217;ll take her to interview surviving members of a backwoods death cult (obviously). Everyone will finish a book and no one will fall in </p>

<p>Summary : How much would you risk to save the ones you love? Would you tempt even the most dangerous fate?Briseis has one chance to save her mother, but she&#8217;ll need to do the impossible: find the last fragment of the deadly Absyrtus Heart. If she is to locate the missing piece, she must turn to the blood relatives she&#8217;s never known, learn about their secret powers, and take her place in their ancient lineage. Briseis is not the only one who wants the Heart, and her enemies will stop at nothing to fulfill their own ruthless plans. The fates tell of a truly dangerous journey, one that could end in more heartache, more death. Bolstered by the sisterhood of ancient magic, can Briseis harness her power to save the people she loves most?</p>

<p>Summary : How much would you risk to save the ones you love? Would you tempt even the most dangerous fate?Briseis has one chance to save her mother, but she&#8217;ll need to do the impossible: find the last fragment of the deadly Absyrtus Heart. If she is to locate the missing piece, she must turn to the blood relatives she&#8217;s never known, learn about their secret powers, and take her place in their ancient lineage. Briseis is not the only one who wants the Heart, and her enemies will stop at nothing to fulfill their own ruthless plans.

<p>Summary : Translated into English here for the first time, The Life of Walatta-Petros (1672) tells the story of an Ethiopian saint who lived from 1592 to 1642 and led a successful nonviolent movement to preserve African Christian beliefs in the face of European protocolonialism. This is the oldest-known book-length biography of an African woman written by Africans before the nineteenth century, and one of the earliest stories of African resistance to European influence. Written by her disciples after her death, The Life of Walatta-Petros praises her as a friend of women, a devoted reader, a skilled preacher, and a radical leader, providing a rare picture of the experiences and thoughts of Africans&#8211;especially women&#8211;before the modern era. In addition to an authoritative and highly readable translation, this edition, which omits the notes and scholarly apparatus of the hardcover, features a new introduction aimed at students and general readers.</p>

<p>Summary : When Caroline Roberts accepted a job at 25 Cromwell Street, the infamous address of Fred and Rose West, she was only 16. Realising that there was something very malevolent about the couple, she left their employment soon after, glad to be rid of them. The story should have ended there. A month later she was abducted by the Wests and suffered violent sexual abuse at their hands before being told that she would be killed and buried. Through a combination of sheer luck and quick thinking, despite the trauma of what had happened, Caroline managed to escape to freedom.</p>

<p>Summary : El permafrost es esa capa de la tierra permanentemente congelada y es tambi?n la membrana que cubre a la protagonista de esta novela. Escrita en primera persona, nos presenta a una mujer en etapa de formaci?n que se protege del exterior, que percibe la superficialidad en todo cuanto la rodea y huye de un entorno que nada tiene que ver con su manera de entender la vida: una madre obsesionada con la salud, omnipresente y controladora, y una hermana que afronta su existencia convencional con medicaci?n y un positivismo irritante. La protagonista, que siente pulsiones suicidas, no permite que nadie se le acerque demasiado, pero al mismo tiempo se entrega con intensidad al sexo con otras mujeres, la literatura y el arte. El pulso entre el hedonismo, los placeres m?s carnales y la muerte es constante en esta novela, as? como el tono mordaz de una protagonista que nos gana con su inteligencia y su humor negr?simo desde la primera p?gina.Repleto de im?genes po?ticas, contundentes y muy </p>

<p>Summary : Quante volte ci forziamo a reprimere un?emozione? Lo facciamo perch? ci vergogniamo dello sguardo degli altri. O perch? siamo abituati a diffidare delle emozioni, analfabeti del discorso emotivo. Eppure, ? proprio quello che sentiamo a permetterci di conoscere il mondo. Ognuna delle emozioni che proviamo ha una storia: la storia di tutte le persone che l?hanno provata, detta, cantata, rivelata, studiata. Una storia di vita segreta e di metamorfosi, legata alla filosofia, che ne ha costruito paradigmi di osservazione e di studio; ma anche alla letteratura e alla poesia. Questo libro ? un viaggio emotivo per tappe: ricostruendo le vicende delle parole con cui diciamo i nostri stati d?animo, traccia, un pezzetto alla volta, un autoritratto ? frammentario, imperfetto. Perch? nel nostro essere vulnerabili ci somigliamo tutti; e riconoscerci emotivi significa prendere coscienza del fatto che abbiamo dei bisogni e che proprio questi bisogni ci rendono umani.</p>

<p>Summary : On Our Own Strength examines the political activities of the most influential intellectual movement in interwar French-occupied Vietnam. The far-reaching work of the Self-Reliant Literary Group (T? L?c V?n ?o?n) included applied design, urban reform, fashion, literature, journalism, and cartoons; its work was deeply political in both form and intent. The Group drew upon a wide range of global intellectual currents and practices to build an enlightened public that would one day serve as the basis of a modern Vietnamese nation. Its nationalist vision sought a nonviolent middle path between colonialism and anticolonial struggle, advocating a process of gradual decolonization that ultimately ended in Vietnamese autonomy. This form of cosmopolitan nationalism proved tremendously popular among ordinary Vietnamese and necessarily shaped local politics, influencing the political agenda of even rival groups such as the newly revived Indochinese Communist Party (ICP).

<p>Summary : A spellbinding story about two girls whose friendship is so intense it not only threatens to destroy them, it changes the trajectory of history.Marie Antoine is the charismatic, spoiled daughter of a sugar baron. At 12 years old, with her blond curls and her unparalleled sense of whimsey, she&#8217;s the leader of all the children in the Golden Mile, an affluent strip of 19th century Montreal. Until one day in 1873, when Sadie Arnett, dark-haired, sly, and brilliant, moves to the neighborhood.Marie and Sadie are immediately united by their passion and intensity, and they attract and repel each other in ways that light each of them on fire. Marie with her bubbly charm sees the light and sweetness of the world, whereas Sadie&#8217;s obsession with darkness is all consuming. Soon their childlike games take on a thrill of danger and then become deadly.Forced to separate, they spend their teenage years engaged in acts of alternating innocence and depravity&#8211;until a singular event unites them once </p>

<p>Summary : Saladin, who united the Arabs and saved Islam from Christian crusaders in the 12th century, is the Islamic world?s preeminent hero. Ruthless in defence of his faith, brilliant in leadership, he also possessed qualities that won admiration from his Christian foes. He knew the limits of violence, showing such tolerance and generosity that many Europeans, appalled at the brutality of their own people, saw him as the exemplar of their own knightly ideals.But Saladin is far more than a historical hero. Builder, literary patron and theologian, he is a man for all times, and a symbol of hope for an Arab world once again divided, and once again wrestling with the problems of dealing with the ?West?. In cities from Damascus to Cairo and beyond, to the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf, Saladin is central to Arab memories, sensibilities and the ideal of a unified Islamic state.In this authoritative biography, historian John Man brings Saladin and his world to life in vivid detail, exploring his </p>

Born after Mao, with no memory of Tiananmen, they are destined to transform both their nation and the world.These millennials, offspring of the one-child policy, face fierce competition to succeed. Pressure starts young, and their road isn&#8217;t easy. Their stories are also like those of young people all over the world: moving out of home, starting a career, falling in love.Wish Lanterns follows the lives of six young Chinese. Dahai is a military child and netizen; &#8216;Fred&#8217; is a daughter of the Party. Lucifer is an aspiring superstar; Snail a country migrant addicted to online games. Xiaoxiao is a hipster from the freezing north; Mia a rebel from Xinjiang in the far west.Alec Ash, a writer in Beijing of the same generation, has given us a vivid, gripping account of young China as it comes of age. Through individual stories, Wish Lanterns shows </p>

<p>Summary : This is the generation that will change China. The youth, over 320 million of them in their teens and twenties, more than the population of the USA. Born after Mao, with no memory of Tiananmen, they are destined to transform both their nation and the world.These millennials, offspring of the one-child policy, face fierce competition to succeed. Pressure starts young, and their road isn&#8217;t easy. Their stories are also like those of young people all over the world: moving out of home, starting a career, falling in love.Wish Lanterns follows the lives of six young Chinese. Dahai is a military child and netizen; &#8216;Fred&#8217; is a daughter of the Party. Lucifer is an aspiring superstar; Snail a country migrant addicted to online games. Xiaoxiao is a hipster from the freezing north; Mia a rebel from Xinjiang in the far west.Alec Ash, a writer in Beijing of the same generation, has given us a vivid, gripping account of young China as it comes of age. Through individual stories, Wish Lanterns shows </p>

<p>Summary : Daniel Paul Schreber began Memoirs of my Nervous Illness in February 1900 while confined in an asylum, as part of an appeal for release. Schreber, second son (the first committed suicide) of an abusive father, was at the peak of a brilliant career in Leipzig when he was appointed Presiding Judge of the Saxon High Court of Appeals. Alas, the stress of his new job proved too much for him, and before long he was hearing voices and feeling suicidal. Within weeks he was committed, having rapidly descended into madness, and was placed under the care of Dr. Paul Emil Flechsig. From the start, Schreber struggled to make sense of what he was seeing and hearing, and in fact Memoirs is so lucid and self-aware, so internally consistent and insightful, that he was released on its strength. Still, reading this man&#8217;s prose is a lesson in subjective reality, by turns funny and terrifying.I existed frequently without a stomach&#8230;.

<p>Summary : Some people have something to say in any conversation and can spot the hidden angles of completely unrelated problems; but how do they do it???So many books, apps, courses, and schools compete for our attention that the problem isn?t a lack of opportunity to sharpen our minds, it?s having to choose between so many options. And yet, more than two thousand years ago, the greatest thinker of Ancient Greece, Aristotle, had already discovered the blueprint of the human mind.Despite the fact that the latest cognitive science shows his blueprint to be exactly what sharpens our reasoning, subtlety of thought, and ability to think in different ways and for ourselves, we have meanwhile replaced it with a simplistic and seductive view of intelligence, education and the mind.?Condensing that blueprint to six &#8216;secrets&#8217;, Craig Adams uncovers the underlying patterns of every discussion and debate we?ve ever had, and shows us how to be both harder to manipulate and more skilful in any conversation </p>

<p>Summary : An O, The Oprah Magazine LGBTQ Book &#8220;Changing the Literary Landscape&#8221;A gorgeously illustrated collection of essays written by today?s queer heroes?featuring contributions from Elton John, Tan France, Gus Kenworthy, Paris Lees, Russell Tovey, Munroe Bergdorf, and many others. The Queer Bible is a celebration of LGBTQ+ history and culture, edited by model, performer, and GQ contributing editor Jack Guinness. <br />
  Our queer heroes write about theirs. <br />
In 2016, model and queer activist Jack Guinness decided that the LGBTQ+ community desperately needed to be reminded of its long and glorious history of stardom?and he was spurred to action. The following year, QueerBible.com was born, an online community devoted to celebrating queer heroes, both past and present. ?So much queer history is hidden or erased,? says Guinness. ?The Queer Bible is a home for all those personal stories and histories.?In this book, contemporary queer icons pay homage to those who helped pave their paths.

<p>Summary : An O, The Oprah Magazine LGBTQ Book &#8220;Changing the Literary Landscape&#8221;A gorgeously illustrated collection of essays written by today?s queer heroes?featuring contributions from Elton John, Tan France, Gus Kenworthy, Paris Lees, Russell Tovey, Munroe Bergdorf, and many others. The Queer Bible is a celebration of LGBTQ+ history and culture, edited by model, performer, and GQ contributing editor Jack Guinness. <br />
  Our queer heroes write about theirs. <br />
In 2016, model and queer activist Jack Guinness decided that the LGBTQ+ community desperately needed to be reminded of its long and glorious history of stardom?and he was spurred to action. The following year, QueerBible.com was born, an online community devoted to celebrating queer heroes, both past and present. ?So much queer history is hidden or erased,? says Guinness. ?The Queer Bible is a home for all those personal stories and histories.?In this book, contemporary queer icons pay homage to those who helped pave their paths.

<p>Summary : From early childhood, Laura James knew she was different, but it wasn&#8217;t until her mid-forties that she found out why. A successful journalist and mother to four children, she had spent her whole life feeling as if she were running a different operating system to those around her. This book charts a year in her life and offers a unique insight into the autistic mind and the journey from diagnosis to acceptance. Drawing on personal experience, research and conversations with experts, she learns how &#8216;different&#8217; doesn&#8217;t need to mean &#8216;less&#8217; and how it&#8217;s never too late for any of us to find our place in the world. Laura explores how and why female autism is so under-diagnosed and very different to that seen in men and boys and explores difficulties and benefits neurodiversity can bring.Listening Length: 8 hours and 18 minutes</p>

<p>Summary : The early middle ages were an exciting period in the history of European architecture, culminating in the development of the Romanesque style. Major architectural innovations were made during this time including the medieval castle, the church spire, and the monastic cloister. By avoiding the traditional emphasis on chronological development, Roger Stalley provides a radically new approach to the subject, exploring issues and themes rather than sequences and dates. In addition to analysing the language of the Romanesque, the book examines the engineering achievements of the builders, focusing on how the great monuments of the age were designed and constructed. Ranging from Gotland to Apulia, Stalley explores the richness and variety of European architecture in terms of the social and religious aspirations of the time. Symbolic meanings associated with architecture are also thoroughly investigated. Written with style and humour, the lively text includes many quotations from ancient </p>

<p>Summary : From Sarah and Evan Rich, the proprietors of Michelin-starred Rich Table?one of San Francisco&#8217;s most coveted reservations?this debut cookbook brings recipes from the restaurant together with the food the Riches cook for friends and family at home.

Full-color photographs and a textured cover with foil stamping capture the rustic elegance of the food and the restaurant, while 85 meticulously tested recipes span salads, vegetables, meat and fish, sweets, drinks, and the pasta dishes that send diners into raptures. This is thoughtful, innovative cooking for those who want to set a rich table at home.</p>

<p>Summary : La storia della Cina si svolge tutta nella tensione tra unit? e molteplicit?. A un&#8217;infinita diversit? di forme di vita, alle divergenze tra visioni del mondo inconciliabili e all&#8217;aspro contrasto fra ricchezza e miseria, si sente continuamente contrapporre l&#8217;orgogliosa affermazione: ?Noi siamo una cosa sola. Una sola ? la nostra tradizione, la nostra cultura, la nostra storia?. L&#8217;attenzione di questa storia millenaria della Cina si rivolge, invece, proprio a queste tensioni, a questi conflitti. Descrive la dura vita dei Cinesi, le sue peculiarit? e la straordinaria ricchezza delle creazioni culturali, e al tempo stesso segue tutti i tentativi di domare questa irrefrenabile molteplicit?: dall&#8217;invenzione della tradizione confuciana alla creazione dell&#8217;impero unitario, fino agli spaventosi eccessi del totalitarismo e al nazionalismo dell&#8217;era presente. Solo chi conosca la molteplicit? che si agita dietro alla facciata unitaria pu? intendere la Cina nella sua storia e nella sua realt? </p>

<p>Summary : One of the greatest challenges for startup teams is scaling because usually there&#8217;s not a blueprint to follow, people are learning their function as they go, and everyone is wearing multiple hats. There can be lots of trial and error, lots of missteps, and lots of valuable time and money squandered as companies scale. Matt Blumberg and his team understand the scaling challenges?they&#8217;ve been there, and it took them nearly 20 years to scale and achieve a successful exit.? Along the way they learned what worked and what didn?t work, and they share their lessons learned in Startup CXO. Unlike other business books, Startup CXO is designed to help each functional leader understand how their function scales, what to anticipate as they scale, and what things to avoid. Beyond providing function-specific advice, tools, and tactics, Startup CXO is a resource for each team member to learn about the other functions, understand other functional challenges, and get greater clarity on how to </p>

<p>Summary : Death ought not to be a happy thing, but then, marriage ought not to be a prison.Seven years ago, Lady Lydia Whiting married for the good of her parents, and widowhood was supposed to mark the beginning of her freedom. But when her husband spurns her from beyond the grave and cuts her from his will, her parents are determined to force her into another wretched marriage of convenience.Fleeing is the only option.Robert Bradshaw has a good, quiet life. Work and his daughter are all he needs, even if others think he ought to remarry. Why should he? His beloved wife was an angel among men, and no other could compare?especially a young widow who is more mouse than woman. But with Lydia?s parents determined to get her back under their thumb, Robert may be her only salvation.</p>

<p>Summary : Seasoned counselors and professors Ron Hawkins and Tim Clinton offer a comprehensive guide that empowers Christian counselors by clarifying their task: to help people take possession of their souls&#8230;through the power of the Spiritunder the authority of the Wordin a supportive community of accountabilitythat they may be like ChristThe authors address head-on today&#8217;s enticing new imitations of true peace and tantalizing opportunities for people in pain to anesthetize themselves. But they also highlight the foundation of hope: God loves, he empowers, and he refuses to abandon his passion for connection with his children.Case studies illustrate how to help people take possession of the thinking self, the feeling self, the decision-making self, the physical self, and the relational self. This comprehensive plan for effective intervention is perfect for lay counselors, students, and professionals looking for ways to integrate their faith and practice.</p>

<p>Summary : From ingredients and recipes to meals and menus across time and space, Eating Culture is a highly engaging overview that illustrates the important role that anthropology and anthropologists have played in understanding food, as well as the key role that food plays in the study of culture.The new edition, now with a full-colour interior, introduces discussions about nomadism, commercializing food, food security, and ethical consumption, including treatment of animals and the long-term environmental and health consequences of meat consumption. &#8220;Grist to the Mill&#8221; sections at the end of each chapter provide further readings and &#8220;Food for Thought&#8221; case studies and exercises help to highlight anthropological methods and approaches. By considering the concept of cuisine and public discourse, this practical guide brings order and insight to our changing relationship with food.</p>

Since then Daniel J. Boorstin?s prophetic vision of an America inundated by its own illusions has become an essential resource for any reader who wants to distinguish the manifold deceptions of our culture from its few enduring truths.Cover design by Matt Dorfman.</p>

El autor aborda qu? puntos hay que tener en cuenta al evaluar una posible compra, cu?ndo vender y cu?ndo no hacerlo, qu? no debe hacer nunca un inversor, c?mo hacer crecer los valores o c?mo elaborar una filosof?a s?lida y coherente de inversi?n que se adapte a cualquier contexto econ?mico.

<p>Summary : A sociological history of literary study?both as a discipline and as a profession.As the humanities in higher education struggle with a labor crisis and with declining enrollments, the travails of literary study are especially profound. No scholar has analyzed the discipline?s contradictions as authoritatively as John Guillory. In this much-anticipated new book, Guillory shows how the study of literature has been organized, both historically and in the modern era, both before and after its professionalization. The traces of this volatile history, he reveals, have solidified into permanent features of the university. Literary study continues to be troubled by the relation between discipline and profession, both in its ambivalence about the literary object and in its anxious embrace of a professionalism that betrays the discipline?s relation to its amateur criticism.In a series of timely essays, Professing Criticism offers an incisive explanation for the perennial churn in literary </p>

<p>Summary : Work with your triggers to find peace in the painful moments and lasting emotional well-being.Psychotherapist David Richo examines the science of triggers and our reactions of fear, anger, and sadness. He helps us understand why our bodies respond before our minds have a chance to make sense of a situation. By looking deeply at the roots of what provokes us&#8211;the words, actions, and even sensory elements like smell&#8211;we find opportunities to understand the origins of our triggers and train our bodies to remain calm in the face of painful memories.The book offers in-the-moment exercises on how to process difficult emotions and physical manifestations in order to to cultivate the inner resources necessary to deal with recurring memories of trauma. When we are triggered, Richo writes, &#8220;we are being bullied by our own unfinished business.&#8221; Explore what your body&#8217;s knee-jerk reactions can teach you.

<p>Summary : A Must-Read for Any Investor Looking to Maximize Their Chances of SuccessBig Mistakes: The Best Investors and Their Worst Investments explores the ways in which the biggest names have failed, and reveals the lessons learned that shaped more successful strategies going forward. Investing can be a rollercoaster of highs and lows, and the investors detailed here show just how low it can go; stories from Warren Buffet, Bill Ackman, Chris Sacca, Jack Bogle, Mark Twain, John Maynard Keynes, and many more illustrate the simple but overlooked concept that investing is really hard, whether you&#8217;re managing a few thousand dollars or a few billion, failures and losses are part of the game. Much more than just anecdotal diversion, these stories set the basis for the book&#8217;s critical focus: learning from mistakes. These investors all recovered from their missteps, and moved forward armed with a wealth of knowledge than can only come from experience. Lessons learned through failure carry a weight </p>

Investing can be a rollercoaster of highs and lows, and the investors detailed here show just how low it can go; stories from Warren Buffet, Bill Ackman, Chris Sacca, Jack Bogle, Mark Twain, John Maynard Keynes, and many more illustrate the simple but overlooked concept that investing is really hard, whether you&amp;#8217;re managing a few thousand dollars or a few billion, failures and losses are part of the game. Much more than just anecdotal diversion, these stories set the basis for the book&amp;#8217;s critical focus: learning from mistakes. These investors all recovered from their missteps, and moved forward armed with a wealth of knowledge than can only come from experience.

<p>Summary : It is the anthropologist?s fate to always be between things: countries, languages, cultures, even realities. But rather than lament this, anthropologist Paul Stoller here celebrates the creative power of the between, showing how it can transform us, changing our conceptions of who we are, what we know, and how we live in the world.Beginning with his early days with the Peace Corps in Africa and culminating with a recent bout with cancer, The Power of the Between is an evocative account of the circuitous path Stoller?s life has taken, offering a fascinating depiction of how a career is shaped over decades of reading and research. Stoller imparts his accumulated wisdom not through grandiose pronouncements but by drawing on his gift for storytelling. Tales of his apprenticeship to a sorcerer in Niger, his studies with Claude L?vi-Strauss in Paris, and his friendships with West African street vendors in New York City accompany philosophical reflections on love, memory, power, courage, </p>

<p>Summary : Jamie Hernandez loves his life. He has his family, his friends, and a successful freelance career at just twenty-three. The only thing missing? His monster. The one Jamie has seen in his dreams for the past five years. Jamie doesn?t know much about the enigmatic man from his visions, but he doesn?t need to. He knows enough. He knows they belong together.Lucien Volaire has been losing his mind for almost half a century, the monster within him steadily taking greater control over his thoughts and actions. He?s destroyed everything he?s touched, including the people he?s cared for. The one thing that could stop his final descent into madness? A mate. So when Luc meets a young man in the desert, one who smells like heaven and doesn?t run in fear, Luc knows he?s met his last chance at redemption.But the more Lucien is enchanted by Jamie, the more reluctant he is to taint him with his own vampire curse. Can Lucien find a balance between love and obsession? Or will those that want Luc out </p>

<p>Summary : All sorcerers are evil. Elisabeth has known that as long as she has known anything. Raised as a foundling in one of Austermeer?s Great Libraries, Elisabeth has grown up among the tools of sorcery?magical grimoires that whisper on shelves and rattle beneath iron chains. If provoked, they transform into grotesque monsters of ink and leather. She hopes to become a warden, charged with protecting the kingdom from their power.Then an act of sabotage releases the library?s most dangerous grimoire. Elisabeth?s desperate intervention implicates her in the crime, and she is torn from her home to face justice in the capital. With no one to turn to but her sworn enemy, the sorcerer Nathaniel Thorn, and his mysterious demonic servant, she finds herself entangled in a centuries-old conspiracy. Not only could the Great Libraries go up in flames, but the world along with them.As her alliance with Nathaniel grows stronger, Elisabeth starts to question everything she?s been taught?about sorcerers, </p>
