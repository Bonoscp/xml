<p>Summary : Environmental Ethics for Canadians is a comprehensive introduction to the core ethical questions shaping current environmental debates. This wide-ranging introduction combines readings by leaders of the environmental ethics and philosophy movement with contemporary selections and original pieces by emerging voices in the field. Readings are complemented by Byron Williston&#8217;s commentary, which provides necessary context for complex theories and explication of abstract concepts in an engaging and accessible style. Organized into three sections, this hybrid text explores thirteen diverse and contentious topics in a balanced and even-handed manner. Areas of discussion include animal welfarism, biocentrism, ecocentrism, ecofeminism, climate change, and environmental aesthetics. Each chapter begins with an &#8216;Ecological Intuition Pump&#8217;, a brief paragraph that encourages students to consider their personal thoughts and attitudes towards &#8216;large picture&#8217; issues that will be discussed in the text </p>

This wide-ranging introduction combines readings by leaders of the environmental ethics and philosophy movement with contemporary selections and original pieces by emerging voices in the field. Readings are complemented by Byron Williston&amp;#8217;s commentary, which provides necessary context for complex theories and explication of abstract concepts in an engaging and accessible style. Organized into three sections, this hybrid text explores thirteen diverse and contentious topics in a balanced and even-handed manner. Areas of discussion include animal welfarism, biocentrism, ecocentrism, ecofeminism, climate change, and environmental aesthetics. Each chapter begins with an &amp;#8216;Ecological Intuition Pump&amp;#8217;, a brief paragraph that encourages students to consider their personal thoughts and attitudes towards &amp;#8216;large picture&amp;#8217; issues that will be discussed in the text Discover the Bestseller Everyone is Talking About: Read Environmental Ethics for Canadians PDF , Reading Environmental Ethics for Canadians pdf , Environmental Ethics for Canadians Handbook , Environmental Ethics for Canadians read , Environmental Ethics for Canadians epub , Environmental Ethics for Canadians in English , Environmental Ethics for Canadians Kindle , Environmental Ethics for Canadians audiobook Environmental Ethics for Canadians Summary.

<p>Summary : In the year of our Lord 1894, I became an outlaw.The day of her wedding, 17 year old Ada&#8217;s life looks good; she loves her husband, and she loves working as an apprentice to her mother, a respected midwife. But after a year of marriage and no pregnancy, in a town where barren women are routinely hanged as witches, her survival depends on leaving behind everything she knows.She joins up with the notorious Hole in the Wall Gang, a band of outlaws led by a preacher-turned-robber known to all as the Kid. Charismatic, grandiose, and mercurial, the Kid is determined to create a safe haven for outcast women. But to make this dream a reality, the Gang hatches a treacherous plan that may get them all killed. And Ada must decide whether she&#8217;s willing to risk her life for the possibility of a new kind of future for them all.Featuring an irresistibly no-nonsense, courageous, and determined heroine, Outlawed dusts off the myth of the old West and reignites the glimmering promise of the frontier </p>

<p>Summary : In The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage Sydney Padua transforms one of the most compelling scientific collaborations into a hilarious set of adventuresMeet two of Victorian London&#8217;s greatest geniuses&#8230; Ada Lovelace, daughter of Lord Byron: mathematician, gambler, and proto-programmer, whose writings contained the first ever appearance of general computing theory, a hundred years before an actual computer was built. And Charles Babbage, eccentric inventor of the Difference Engine, an enormous clockwork calculating machine that would have been the first computer, if he had ever finished it.But what if things had been different? The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage presents a delightful alternate reality in which Lovelace and Babbage do build the Difference Engine and use it to create runaway economic models, battle the scourge of spelling errors, explore the wider realms of mathematics and, of course, fight crime &#8211; for the sake of both London and science. </p>

<p>Summary : Mystery. Manipulation. Murder. Cults are associated with all of these. But what really goes on inside them? More specifically, what goes on inside the minds of cult leaders and the people who join them? Based on the hit podcast Cults, this is essential reading for any true crime fan.Cults prey on the very attributes that make us human: our desire to belong; to find a deeper meaning in life; to live everyday with divine purpose. Their existence creates a sense that any one of us, at any time, could step off the cliff?s edge and fall into that daunting abyss of manipulation and unhinged dedication to a misplaced cause.

<p>Summary : Rendered with reassuring words and pastoral scenes, this soothing lullaby of a story is sure to settle even the most restless of cubs.Mouse is rushing to her nest.In soft, dry grasses she will rest.Geese are calling, a chilly wind is blowing, and the sky is turning gray. Winter is on its way. For Mama Bear and Small Bear, that means it?s time to tuck into their den for a long sleep. But Mouse is scurrying by, and Chipmunk is still gathering nuts beside the lake. And look at Hare and Skunk, still romping through the leaves! Why can?t Small Bear stay up, too? To each question, Mama Bear responds with the coziest of answers, finally painting a dreamy picture of the brightening colors and new adventures that will greet Small Bear in the spring. But first comes sleep, in this irresistible invitation to drowsy little cubs everywhere.</p>

<p>Summary : Jane lived happily in Miami Beach with her father until his failed suicide attempt and relocation to a mental hospital forced her into the foster care system. By chance, Jane is assigned to foster parents in central Florida who are deeply involved in the Second Day Believers&amp;mdasha cult focused on the ?cleansing? of mental impurities in their children, and the sanctity of the internal organs of farm animals. Jane is quickly initiated into the Second Day Believers, but her father?s lingering voice prevents her from becoming entirely indoctrinated. Despite Jane?s resistance, she is revered in the cult as the second coming of the late wife of Sir One, the leader of the Second Day Believers. Poised to rise through the ranks of the insane cult and marry their leader, Jane must make a difficult choice.Stupid Children is a story inspired by Katherine Dunn?s, Geek Love, and written in a voice similar to Donald Barthelme. Hilarious, offbeat, fast-paced and wildly imaginative, Zion, a </p>

<p>Summary : Frieder is zestien en moet de hele zomer studeren om niet te blijven zitten. Daarom moet hij bij zijn norse opa logeren terwijl de rest van zijn familie op vakantie gaat. Maar deze zomer gaat niets zoals verwacht. Het is de zomer waarin hij Beate ontmoet bij het zwembad, het meisje in het groene badpak dat zijn hart op hol brengt. De zomer waarin hij voor het eerst begrijpt hoe zijn familie in elkaar zit en voor het eerst geconfronteerd wordt met de betekenis van vriendschap, liefde en verlies. Na deze zomer zal niets meer hetzelfde zijn.De grote zomer, is een lichtend warme en sfeervolle coming-of-age-roman, voor iedereen die zich die ene zomer herinnert waarin hij of zij voor het eerst verliefd werd.</p>

<p>Summary : Seventeen-year-old Iris Hollow has always been strange. Something happened to her and her two older sisters when they were children, something they can?t quite remember but that left each of them with an identical half-moon scar at the base of their throats. Iris has spent most of her teenage years trying to avoid the weirdness that sticks to her like tar. But when her eldest sister, Grey, goes missing under suspicious circumstances, Iris learns just how weird her life can get: horned men start shadowing her, a corpse falls out of her sister?s ceiling, and ugly, impossible memories start to twist their way to the forefront of her mind. As Iris retraces Grey?s last known footsteps and follows the increasingly bizarre trail of breadcrumbs she left behind, it becomes apparent that the only way to save her sister is to decipher the mystery of what happened to them as children. The closer Iris gets to the truth, the closer she comes to understanding that the answer is dark and dangerous ? </p>

Between trying not to die on this hostile alien world and helping my newly-pregnant friends (I am a biologist, after all) I&#8217;ve had a lot going on. But when I stumble into the alien forge and find the huge, quiet weapons master Xyan there, I have a whole new task at hand. Xyan &#8211; the biggest, strongest, most serious alien I&#8217;ve ever met &#8211; offers to help me study the Sea Sand biology. I may be busy, but not too busy for that.

But he&#8217;s totally unreadable, and he hasn&#8217;t said anything about having a mate.Even so, I can&#8217;t help but feel there&#8217;s something between us.Maybe I can still love him even if he isn&#8217;t </p>

<p>Summary : Fate always has a plan for us. But sometimes I wonder if fate really knows what the hell she?s doing.With my best friend missing, my life is a chaotic mess. This supernatural world I?ve found myself in is placing new pawns on the table faster than I can keep track. The line between friend and foe is murky, and I don?t plan on pulling a knife out of my back anytime soon.That?s not to mention I?m trying to juggle my four swoon-worthy as hell fated mate bonds on top of my talking golden retriever, a war between the Night and the Light, and my newfound magical abilities. The trials before me won?t be easy, and if fate has her way, I?m in for a whole bucket load of heartache. The question is, will I let it break me?I?m starting to think it just might.Moons, would it kill the Gods to give me a bit of a break?Apparently.Too bad I?m not going down without one hell of a fight.Bound by Light is a full-length paranormal romance novel and the second book in the Fates Mark series. It does end on </p>

<p>Summary : True love is at stake in this charming, debut romantic comedy.Cassie Greenberg loves being an artist, but it?s a tough way to make a living. On the brink of eviction, she?s desperate when she finds a too-good-to-be-true apartment in a beautiful Chicago neighborhood. Cassie knows there has to be a catch?only someone with a secret to hide would rent out a room for that price.Of course, her new roommate Frederick J. Fitzwilliam is far from normal. He sleeps all day, is out at night on business, and talks like he walked out of a regency romance novel. He also leaves Cassie heart-melting notes around the apartment, cares about her art, and asks about her day. And he doesn?t look half bad shirtless, on the rare occasions they?re both home and awake. But when Cassie finds bags of blood in the fridge that definitely weren?t there earlier, Frederick has to come clean&#8230; Cassie?s sexy new roommate is a vampire. And he has a proposition for her.</p>

<p>Summary : Eleanor West?s Home for Wayward ChildrenNo SolicitationsNo VisitorsNo QuestsChildren have always disappeared under the right conditions; slipping through the shadows under a bed or at the back of a wardrobe, tumbling down rabbit holes and into old wells, and emerging somewhere&#8230; else.But magical lands have little need for used-up miracle children.Nancy tumbled once, but now she?s back. The things she?s experienced&#8230; they change a person. The children under Miss West?s care understand all too well. And each of them is seeking a way back to their own fantasy world.But Nancy?s arrival marks a change at the Home. There?s a darkness just around each corner, and when tragedy strikes, it?s up to Nancy and her new-found schoolmates to get to the heart of the matter.No matter the cost.</p>

<p>Summary : HR has lost its way and needs to find a new direction.The central question this book sets out to answer is: if we are to survive and thrive in this new, volatile business world, how do we lead, manage, engage and support our employees in a radically different way?HR departments, and companies, need to transform their approach. This entails not simply tinkering with the process or the mechanics, but taking a completely fresh look at the entire scenario. It&#8217;s the difference between spending hours deciding how many grades there should be in an employee grading system, and asking if grading people actually increases their ability to perform better in the first place.To achieve this change, Disruptive HR has three pillars:1. Treating employees as adults not children2. Treating employees as consumers or customers (not a one-size-fits-all approach)3. Treating employees as human beingsEACH: Employees as Adults, Consumers and Human beings. (Each of us is different, each of us deserves </p>

<p>Summary : Nineteen Arab women journalists speak out about what it&#8217;s like to report on their changing homelands in this first-of-its-kind essay collection, with a foreword by CNN chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour A growing number of intrepid Arab and Middle Eastern sahafiyat&#8211;female journalists&#8211;are working tirelessly to shape nuanced narratives about their changing homelands, often risking their lives on the front lines of war. From sexual harassment on the streets of Cairo to the difficulty of traveling without a male relative in Yemen, their challenges are unique&#8211;as are their advantages, such as being able to speak candidly with other women at a Syrian medical clinic or with men on Whatsapp who will go on to become ISIS fighters, rebels, or pro-regime soldiers.In Our Women on the Ground, nineteen of these women tell us, in their own words, about what it&#8217;s like to report on conflicts that (quite literally) hit close to home.

<p>Summary : Las modistas de Auschwitz cuenta la historia de las veinticinco mujeres y adolescentes, la mayor?a jud?as, que en medio del horror absoluto del campo de exterminio de Auschwitz-Birkenau fueron seleccionadas para confeccionar ropa a medida para las damas de la alta sociedad nazi. Sus habilidades se convirtieron en su ?nica esperanza de salvarse de una muerte segura en las c?maras de gas.Bas?ndose en un impresionante trabajo de investigaci?n, incluso en entrevistas con la ?ltima costurera superviviente, la novelista e historiadora Lucy Adlington ofrece una detallada e inestimable reconstrucci?n del v?nculo de amistad que un?a a aquellas valientes mujeres y su papel en la resistencia del campo, al tiempo que expone la codicia, la crueldad y la hipocres?a del Tercer Reich.Este libro ofrece una nueva mirada a un cap?tulo poco conocido de la Segunda Guerra Mundial y del Holocausto y saca a la luz historias de vidas excepcionales que deben ser contadas antes de que sea demasiado tarde.</p>

<p>Summary : The mesmerising adult debut from number one New York Times best-selling author Leigh Bardugo. Galaxy &#8216;Alex&#8217; Stern is the most unlikely member of Yale&#8217;s freshman class. Raised in the Los Angeles hinterlands by a hippie mom, Alex dropped out of school early and into a world of shady drug dealer boyfriends, dead-end jobs, and much, much worse. By age 20, she is the sole survivor of a horrific, unsolved multiple homicide. Some might say she&#8217;s thrown her life away. But at her hospital bed, Alex is offered a second chance: to attend one of the world&#8217;s most elite universities on a full ride. What&#8217;s the catch, and why her? Still searching for answers, Alex arrives in New Haven tasked by her mysterious benefactors with monitoring the activities of Yale&#8217;s secret societies, well-known to be haunts of the future rich and powerful. But their occult activities are revealed to be more sinister and more extraordinary than she ever imagined&#8230;. Welcome to a world of secret societies and the occult </p>

<p>Summary : A gripping and explosive account of Vladimir Putin&#8217;s tyranny, charting his rise from spy to tsar, exposing the events that led to his invasion of Ukraine and his assault on Europe.In Killer in the Kremlin, award-winning journalist John Sweeney takes readers from the heart of Putin&#8217;s Russia to the killing fields of Chechnya, to the embattled cities of an invaded Ukraine.In a disturbing expos? of Putin&#8217;s sinister ambition, Sweeney draws on thirty years of his own reporting &#8211; from the Moscow apartment bombings to the atrocities committed by the Russian Army in Chechnya, to the annexation of Crimea and a confrontation with Putin over the shooting down of flight MH17 &#8211; to understand the true extent of Putin&#8217;s long war.Drawing on eyewitness accounts and compelling testimony from those who have suffered at Putin&#8217;s hand, we see the heroism of the Russian opposition, the bravery of the Ukrainian resistance, and the brutality with which the Kremlin responds to such acts of defiance, </p>

<p>Summary : The Last King in India is the story of an extraordinary man whose memory still divides opinion sharply today. Was he, as the British described him, a debauched ruler who spent his time with &#8216;fiddlers, eunuchs and women&#8217; instead of running the kingdom? Or, as most Indians believe, a gifted poet whose works are still quoted today, and who was robbed of his throne by the East India Company? Somewhere in between the two extremes lies a complex character: a man who married over 350 women, directed theatrical events lasting a month, and built a fairytale palace in Lucknow. Wajid Ali Shah was written out of the history books after his kingdom was annexed in 1856. Some even thought he had been killed during the mutiny the following year. But he lived on in Calcutta where he spent the last thirty years of his life trying to recreate his lost paradise. He remained a constant problem for the government of India, with his extravagance, his menagerie and his wives &#8211; in that order.</p>

<p>Summary : The Last King in India is the story of an extraordinary man whose memory still divides opinion sharply today. Was he, as the British described him, a debauched ruler who spent his time with &#8216;fiddlers, eunuchs and women&#8217; instead of running the kingdom? Or, as most Indians believe, a gifted poet whose works are still quoted today, and who was robbed of his throne by the East India Company? Somewhere in between the two extremes lies a complex character: a man who married over 350 women, directed theatrical events lasting a month, and built a fairytale palace in Lucknow. Wajid Ali Shah was written out of the history books after his kingdom was annexed in 1856. Some even thought he had been killed during the mutiny the following year. But he lived on in Calcutta where he spent the last thirty years of his life trying to recreate his lost paradise. He remained a constant problem for the government of India, with his extravagance, his menagerie and his wives &#8211; in that order.</p>

<p>Summary : Montaggio del suono, sound design, composizione, consulenza e produzione musicale e mixaggio sono tessere diverse di un unico mosaico con una sola funzione espressiva: far affiorare e consolidare la tensione emotiva di un audiovisivo, coniugando le esperienze percettive di ascolto e vista. Occuparsi di suono e musica per un film significa adoperarsi per mettere in contatto mondi paralleli. L?approccio ? artigianale. Si opera essenzialmente nel dominio subliminale combinando creativit?, tecnica e tecnologia. La materia prima ? il suono. Certo, non il suono puro, non la musica assoluta. C?? un partner importante col quale misurarsi e interagire: le immagini, appunto. Il sound designer ? colui che, riferendo e confrontandosi con le altre figure chiave della filiera, presiede alla struttura complessiva del concetto sonoro, al colore aurale del film.</p>

<p>Summary : This is a book I wrote. Because I wrote it, I had to figure out what to put on the back cover to explain what it is. I tried to write a long, third-person summary that would imply how great the book is and also sound vaguely authoritative&#8211;like maybe someone who isn?t me wrote it&#8211;but I soon discovered that I?m not sneaky enough to pull it off convincingly. So I decided to just make a list of things that are in the book:PicturesWordsStories about things that happened to meStories about things that happened to other people because of meEight billion dollars*Stories about dogsThe secret to eternal happiness**These are lies. Perhaps I have underestimated my sneakiness!</p>

<p>Summary : Lovely Sorcha is the seventh child and only daughter of Lord Colum of Sevenwaters. Bereft of a mother, she is comforted by her six brothers who love and protect her. Sorcha is the light in their lives: they are determined that she know only contentment.But Sorcha&#8217;s joy is shattered when her father is bewitched by his new wife, an evil enchantress who binds her brothers with a terrible spell, a spell which only Sorcha can lift?by staying silent. If she speaks before she completes the quest set to her by the Fair Folk and their queen, the Lady of the Forest, she will lose her brothers forever.When Sorcha is kidnapped by the enemies of Sevenwaters and taken to a foreign land, she is torn between the desire to save her beloved brothers, and a love that comes only once. Sorcha despairs at ever being able to complete her task, but the magic of the Fair Folk knows no boundaries, and love is the strongest magic of them all&#8230;</p>

<p>Summary : Now a film from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation!After a young Canadian Aboriginal girl is murdered in 1971, it takes 20 years of inaction and prejudice before the police finally find the real killers. Helen Betty Osbourne was only nineteen when she was whisked away from her small-town Manitoba community and stabbed to death with a screwdriver, after which her body was dumped at a nearby pump house. Finally the police decided to reopen the case despite locals pointing fingers at the Cree community &#8211; but the real killers, a gang of drunk hoodlums, were doing their best to get away with their crimes.</p>

<p>Summary : Now a film from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation!After a young Canadian Aboriginal girl is murdered in 1971, it takes 20 years of inaction and prejudice before the police finally find the real killers. Helen Betty Osbourne was only nineteen when she was whisked away from her small-town Manitoba community and stabbed to death with a screwdriver, after which her body was dumped at a nearby pump house. Finally the police decided to reopen the case despite locals pointing fingers at the Cree community &#8211; but the real killers, a gang of drunk hoodlums, were doing their best to get away with their crimes.</p>

Bhante G speaks directly to how we can cultivate loving-kindness to find emotional clarity, overcome anger, and become more peaceful?both on and off the meditation cushion.</p>

<p>Summary : When we were eleven, Oliver Ford Pemberton dared me to jump off a barn roof. He said you couldn?t break a leg from a 12-foot-jump.He lied.(You can also break a collarbone, which served him right as far as I was concerned.)I wish I could say it was the last dare I ever took from him, the last bet I ever made with him, the last time I ever trusted Oliver Ford Pemberton.But it wasn?t.Because he had the nerve to grow up gorgeous, charming, and sexy. And as we got older, the dares only got dirtier?and the betting stakes higher?until finally, he left me in pieces. I swore I?d never talk to him again.But twenty years after I took that flying leap, he?s back in my life, daring me to risk everything for him: my job, my self-worth, and my heart.How many chances does love deserve?</p>

<p>Summary : Increased redevelopment, the dismantling of public housing, and increasing housing costs are forcing a shift in migration of lower income and transit dependent populations to the suburbs. These suburbs are often missing basic transportation, and strategies to address this are lacking. This absence of public transit creates barriers to viable employment and accessibility to cultural networks, and plays a role in increasing social inequality.This book investigates how housing and transport policy have played their role in creating these &#8220;Transit Deserts,&#8221; and what impact race has upon those likely to be affected. Diane Jones Allen uses research from New Orleans, Baltimore, and Chicago to explore the forces at work in these situations, as well as proposing potential solutions. Mapping, interviews, photographs, and narratives all come together to highlight the inequities and challenges in Transit Deserts, where a lack of access can make all journeys, such as to jobs, stores, or </p>

<p>Summary : With her irresistible urge to tell a joke in every situation ? even when she really, really shouldn&#8217;t ? twelve-year-old Jacky Ha-Ha loves to make people laugh. And cracking wise helps distract her from thinking about not-so-funny things in her life, like her mom serving in a dangerous, faraway war, and a dad who&#8217;s hardly ever home.But no matter how much fun Jacky has, she can&#8217;t seem to escape her worries. So one starlit night, she makes a promise to keep her family together&#8230; even if she has to give up the one thing that makes her happy. But can she stop being Jacky Ha-Ha, if that&#8217;s who she really is?</p>

<p>Summary : The story of how the East India Company took over large swaths of Asia, and the devastating results of the corporation running a country.In August 1765, the East India Company defeated the young Mughal emperor and set up, in his place, a government run by English traders who collected taxes through means of a private army.The creation of this new government marked the moment that the East India Company ceased to be a conventional company and became something much more unusual: an international corporation transformed into an aggressive colonial power. Over the course of the next 47 years, the company&#8217;s reach grew until almost all of India south of Delhi was effectively ruled from a boardroom in the city of London.</p>

<p>Summary : The story of how the East India Company took over large swaths of Asia, and the devastating results of the corporation running a country.In August 1765, the East India Company defeated the young Mughal emperor and set up, in his place, a government run by English traders who collected taxes through means of a private army.The creation of this new government marked the moment that the East India Company ceased to be a conventional company and became something much more unusual: an international corporation transformed into an aggressive colonial power. Over the course of the next 47 years, the company&#8217;s reach grew until almost all of India south of Delhi was effectively ruled from a boardroom in the city of London.</p>

Only they didn&#8217;t see it that way: they felt </p>

She isn?t willing to waste a moment or miss out on an experience when she has no idea whether she shares the same fatal genetic condition as her mother. Besides, she has way too much to do, traveling the globe and showing her millions of YouTube followers the joy in seizing every moment.But after her half-sister suddenly leaves Vanessa in custody of her infant daughter, she is housebound, on mommy duty for the foreseeable future, and feeling totally out of her element.The last person she expects to show up offering help is the unbelievably hot lawyer who lives next door, Adrian Copeland. After all, she barely knows him. But as they get closer, Vanessa realizes that her carefree ways and his need for a structured plan could never be compatible for the long term. </p>

<p>Summary : Efter Francos seger i spanska inb?rdeskriget 1939 tvingades hundratusentals spanjorer att fly till s?dra Frankrike och Nordafrika, d?r de internerades i l?ger. Under andra v?rldskriget valde m?nga att ta v?rvning i de fria franska styrkorna i Nordafrika och senare i franska arm?n f?r att forts?tta k?mpa mot fascismen. De hoppades att Spanien skulle befrias n?r axelmakterna hade besegrats.I?Slumpens sp?r?s?ker Paco Roca upp en nittiofyra?rig spansk krigsveteran som motvilligt ber?ttar om sina upplevelser i Nordafrika och Europa. Han tillh?rde Nionde kompaniet, ?La Nueve?, som spelade en viktig roll vid befrielsen av Paris.Ramber?ttelsen ?r fiktiv, men de historiska skildringarna bygger p? grundlig forskning om de spanska republikanernas insatser under andra v?rldskriget. Serieromanen blir en hyllning till alla dem som i likhet med huvudpersonen ans?g att det var lika n?dv?ndigt att k?mpa mot fascismen som att andas.</p>

<p>Summary : Antonio Padilla&#8217;s Fantastic Numbers and Where to Find Them is a fun, dazzling exploration of the strange numbers that illuminate the ultimate nature of realityFor particularly brilliant theoretical physicists like James Clerk Maxwell, Paul Dirac, or Albert Einstein, the search for mathematical truths led to strange new understandings of the ultimate nature of reality. But what are these truths? What are the mysterious numbers that explain the universe? In Fantastic Numbers and Where to Find Them, the leading theoretical physicist and YouTube star Antonio Padilla takes us on an irreverent cosmic tour of nine of the most extraordinary numbers in physics, offering a startling picture of how the universe works. These strange numbers include:? Graham?s number, which is so large that if you thought about it in the wrong way, your head would collapse into a singularity.? TREE(3), whose finite nature can never be definitively proved, because to do so would take so much time that the universe </p>

<p>Summary : What is happiness? What is not happiness? How can one lead a truly happy life? What are the differences between happiness, joy, gladness, contentment and pleasure? In this concise and easy-to-read book, noted philosopher and Islamic scholar, Prince Ghazi of Jordan, reviews the classical philosophical and religious answers to these questions and then shows Islam&#8217;s perspective on the issue based on the Qur&#8217;an and saying of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW.) The answer is a surprising one to which everyone can relate.</p>

<p>Summary : In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe has neither the look nor the voice of divinity, and is scorned and rejected by her kin. Increasingly isolated, she turns to mortals for companionship, leading her to discover a power forbidden to the gods: witchcraft.When love drives Circe to cast a dark spell, wrathful Zeus banishes her to the remote island of Aiaia. There she learns to harness her occult craft, drawing strength from nature. But she will not always be alone; many are destined to pass through Circe&#8217;s place of exile, entwining their fates with hers. The messenger god, Hermes. The craftsman, Daedalus. A ship bearing a golden fleece. And wily Odysseus, on his epic voyage home.There is danger for a solitary woman in this world, and Circe&#8217;s independence draws the wrath of men and gods alike. To protect what she holds dear, Circe must decide whether she belongs with the deities she is born from, or the mortals she has come to </p>

<p>Summary : Empath to Mystic is a step by step tutorial that allows you to find spiritual healing and use this knowledge to live your life to the fullest and to at last find gratitude for your empathic gifts. It allows you to take the reins of your intuition and balance your third eye chakra. Finally overcoming old stories about being a person who is too sensitive.The world?s most well known modern mystics, from The Dalai Lama and Deepak Chopra to Pema Chodron and Eckart Tolle emphasize the importance of practice when seeking inspiration, empowerment, healing, and connection with your inner voice. So woven throughout the author?s captivating discussions are journaling prompts, practical action steps, thoughtful visualizations, and practices to take you to the next level.Without consistent practice and a clear system of growth, you may experience being an empath as a burden instead of a doorway to knowing your divinity. You may feel that loving self-care is beyond reach, all used up, and that </p>

<p>Summary : Solo un destino parec?a aguardar a una ni?a nacida en el seno de la alta burgues?a brit?nica: esperar la llegada de la mayor?a de edad para ser presentada en sociedad y arreglar un buen matrimonio. Pero Jane Birkin escap? a ?l cuando la pel?cula de Antonioni Blow-Up la convirti? en musa del Swinging London y la llev? en 1968 a un Par?s que se preparaba para la revoluci?n. All? conocer?a al m?sico Serge Gainsbourg, con el que emprender?a una historia de amor convertida en leyenda.Un recorrido volcado en estos diarios en los que Birkin rememora su vida hasta 1982, a?o en que decide romper su relaci?n con Gainsbourg para emprender un nuevo camino. Un recorrido jalonado por discos, pel?culas, fiestas, viajes y esc?ndalos planetarios, como el provocado por Jet&#8217;aime&#8230; moi non plus, la canci?n que la convertir?a en figura ic?nica de la Francia de los setenta. Pero tambi?n por la sombra de la depresi?n y la muerte, que terminar?a cambi?ndolo todo.</p>

<p>Summary : Solo un destino parec?a aguardar a una ni?a nacida en el seno de la alta burgues?a brit?nica: esperar la llegada de la mayor?a de edad para ser presentada en sociedad y arreglar un buen matrimonio. Pero Jane Birkin escap? a ?l cuando la pel?cula de Antonioni Blow-Up la convirti? en musa del Swinging London y la llev? en 1968 a un Par?s que se preparaba para la revoluci?n. All? conocer?a al m?sico Serge Gainsbourg, con el que emprender?a una historia de amor convertida en leyenda.Un recorrido volcado en estos diarios en los que Birkin rememora su vida hasta 1982, a?o en que decide romper su relaci?n con Gainsbourg para emprender un nuevo camino. Un recorrido jalonado por discos, pel?culas, fiestas, viajes y esc?ndalos planetarios, como el provocado por Jet&#8217;aime&#8230; moi non plus, la canci?n que la convertir?a en figura ic?nica de la Francia de los setenta. Pero tambi?n por la sombra de la depresi?n y la muerte, que terminar?a cambi?ndolo todo.</p>

<p>Summary : Imagine your husband wrote you a letter, to be opened after his death. Imagine, too, that the letter contains his deepest, darkest secret &#8211; something with the potential to destroy not only the life you have built together but the lives of others as well. And then imagine that you stumble across that letter while your husband is still very much alive&#8230;Cecilia Fitzpatrick has achieved it all &#8211; she&#8217;s an incredibly successful businesswoman, a pillar of her small community, a devoted wife and mother. Her life is as orderly and spotless as her home. But that letter is about to change everything &#8211; and not just for her. There are other women who barely know Cecilia &#8211; or each other &#8211; but they, too, are about to feel the earth-shattering repercussions of her husband&#8217;s secret.</p>

<p>Summary : Wilderness Knits for the Home is Linka Neumann?s second book, showcasing a stunning collection of homeware knits to make while embracing the Scandinavian spirit and cosying up next to a warm fire. After the success of Wilderness Knits, with its cosy jumpers and cardigans set against the backdrop of the Norwegian landscape, Linka brings us gorgeous wall hangings, cushions, blankets (including for your dog!) and more. Once again, set in the stunning Norwegian countryside, the book inspires you to knit these beautiful creations and embrace the aesthetic of the Scandinavian wilderness. As ever, Linka uses her environment to inspire her as well as animals from the snowy north ? with dogs, orcas, polar bears and reindeers finding their way into her designs. If making jumpers and cardigans with Scandi-style yokes feels too complicated for you, these simpler shapes of squares and rectangles will give you the confidence to make your own creations with similar designs. Including 27 projects ? </p>

<p>Summary : Wilderness Knits for the Home is Linka Neumann?s second book, showcasing a stunning collection of homeware knits to make while embracing the Scandinavian spirit and cosying up next to a warm fire. After the success of Wilderness Knits, with its cosy jumpers and cardigans set against the backdrop of the Norwegian landscape, Linka brings us gorgeous wall hangings, cushions, blankets (including for your dog!) and more. Once again, set in the stunning Norwegian countryside, the book inspires you to knit these beautiful creations and embrace the aesthetic of the Scandinavian wilderness. As ever, Linka uses her environment to inspire her as well as animals from the snowy north ? with dogs, orcas, polar bears and reindeers finding their way into her designs. If making jumpers and cardigans with Scandi-style yokes feels too complicated for you, these simpler shapes of squares and rectangles will give you the confidence to make your own creations with similar designs.

<p>Summary : Die 16-j?hrige Aza Holmes hatte ganz sicher nicht vor, sich an der Suche nach dem verschwundenen Milliard?r Russell Pickett zu beteiligen. Sie hat genug mit ihren eigenen Sorgen und ?ngsten zu k?mpfen, die ihre Gedankenwelt zwanghaft beherrschen. Doch als eine Hunderttausend-Dollar-Belohnung auf dem Spiel steht und ihre furchtlose beste Freundin Daisy es kaum erwarten kann, das Geheimnis um Pickett aufzukl?ren, macht Aza mit. Sie versucht Mut zu beweisen und ?berwindet durch Daisy nicht nur kleine Hindernisse, sondern auch gro?e Gegens?tze, die sie von anderen Menschen trennen. F?r Aza wird es ein gro?es Abenteuer und eine Reise ins Zentrum ihrer Gedankenspirale, der sie zu entkommen versucht.</p>

<p>Summary : After the grim confrontation with Queen Katharine, the rebellion lies in tatters.

When Mirabella arrives, seemingly under a banner of truce, Katharine begins to yearn for the closeness that Mirabella and Arsinoe share. But as the two circle each other, the dead queens hiss caution?Mirabella is not to be trusted.In this conclusion to the Three Dark Crowns series, three sisters will rise to fight as the secrets of Fennbirn?s history are laid bare. Allegiances will shift. Bonds will be tested. But the fate of the island lies in the hands of its queens. It always has.</p>

<p>Summary : The Anatomy of an Actor series takes ten roles by a single actor, each studied in a dedicated chapter, and identifies the key elements that made the performances exceptional &#8211; carefully examining the actor&#8217;s craft for both a professional audience and movie fans alike. This title looks at Hollywood icon Tom Cruise. First cast by Francis Ford Coppola in The Outsiders (1983), he gained international notoriety in the mid-1980s thanks to Tony Scott&#8217;s Top Gun (1986).

<p>Summary : THE BATTLE FOR HUMAN EVOLUTION BEGINS NOW.Centuries ago, humans colonised J?rn, a lonely planet on the far side of the galaxy, only to discover that the planet was killing them. The culprit, a native spore, carried on every wind to every corner of the globe.Genetic engineering, blending Earth and J?rn DNA, saved their crops and livestock, but for humans there was no cure. Instead they took to the skies, turning their colony ships into cities that floated out of the spore?s reach.Hero Regan is special, and not in a way she likes. She hears voices, voices in her head that other people can?t. Surrounded by butlers, bodyguards and tutors, insulated from the outside world, her only solace is Fink, a six-hundred-kilogram, genetically engineered ruc-pard. They share lives, thoughts, triple-chocolate marshmallow ice-cream and the burning desire for freedom.Their chance comes when Hero is allowed to attend school in Cumulus City. Here Hero discovers she is an unwitting part of a master plan </p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  Hola, mga Hampaslupa! <br />
Sa totoo lang, ayoko sanang gumawa ng libro. Kasi ayoko &#8216;yung masyadong nahahalata na matalino ako.Lalong dadami &#8216;yung mga haters na nagsasabing dalawa raw ang likod ko!My gad! As if naman nakakabawass ng ganda &#8216;yun! Well, hindi lang nila matanggap na nung nagsabog ng kagandahan, kaseksihan, at katalinuhan e dun lang nagpaulan sa hacienda ko. Pwe!Ilang taon na akong nagre-reyna-reynahan sa Social Media, at itong librong ito ang naging bunga ng aking imahinasyon, mga hampaslupa na hindi napapagod magpaalala na wala akong dede! Andito ang lahat ng mga opinion at advice ko tungkol sa mga feeling RK, mga nagpopost ng maharot na pictures pero may #respect, mga manggagamit, paasa at hipokrita! Lalo na sa mga nabiktima ng LandianNgKahapon# na may nakilala lang sa Facebook tapos magtatanong how to move on daw e hindi naman naging sila, at marami pang iba na hindi ko na pwedeng ikwento pa!</p>

<p>Summary : Around one in one hundred people in the UK are autistic, yet there remains a fundamental misunderstanding of what autism is. It is rare that autistic people get to share their own experiences, show how creative and talented and passionate they are, how different they are from media stereotypes. This insightful and eye-opening collection of essays, fiction and visual art showcases the immense talents of some of the UK&#8217;s most exciting writers and artists &#8211; who just happen to be on the spectrum. Here they reclaim the power to speak for themselves and redefine what it means to be autistic. Stim invites the reader into the lives, experiences, minds of the eighteen contributors, and asks them to recognise the hurdles of being autistic in a non-autistic world and to uncover the empathy and understanding necessary to continue to champion brilliant yet unheard voices.</p>

<p>Summary : A moving story of love, friendship, grief, healing, and the magical bond between a woman and her dog.When a woman unexpectedly loses her lifelong best friend and mentor, she finds herself burdened with the unwanted dog he has left behind. Her own battle against grief is intensified by the mute suffering of the dog, a huge Great Dane traumatized by the inexplicable disappearance of its master, and by the threat of eviction: dogs are prohibited in her apartment building.While others worry that grief has made her a victim of magical thinking, the woman refuses to be separated from the dog except for brief periods of time. Isolated from the rest of the world, increasingly obsessed with the dog&#8217;s care, determined to read its mind and fathom its heart, she comes dangerously close to unraveling. But while troubles abound, rich and surprising rewards lie in store for both of them.Elegiac and searching, The Friend is both a meditation on loss and a celebration of human-canine devotion.</p>

In Children of the City, David Nasaw re-creates this period in our social history from the vantage point of the children who grew up then. Drawing on hundreds of memoirs, autobiographies, oral histories and unpublished?and until now unexamined?primary source materials from cities across the country, he provides us with a warm and eloquent portrait of these children, their families, their daily lives, their fears, and their dreams.Illustrated with 68 photographs from the period, many never before published, Children of the City offers a vibrant portrait of a </p>

<p>Summary : Economics Explained has an announced purpose to explain that mysterious thing called economics. But there is a new urgency to the book. It is announced in the first sentence of the introduction: &#8220;Just in case the reader-to-be hasn&#8217;t noticed, disturbing things are going on in the American economy these days.&#8221; This new edition is about these disturbing things: a trend toward inequality of incomes, the appearance of a new &#8220;globalized&#8221; capitalism, the &#8220;specter&#8221; of inflation. As before, Robert Heilbroner and Lester Thurow treat these problems in language that seeks to make clear their causes and treatments. In this straightforward, highly accessible reference, Heilbroner and Thurow&#8211;two of America&#8217;s most respected and articulate economists&#8211;offer all the economics essential for becoming an effective investor, a savvy business decision maker, or simply an informed member of society.</p>

<p>Summary : Una fascinante exploraci?n del papel del f?tbol en nuestro mundo. La pol?tica y el f?tbol siempre han ido de la mano. Desde los mundiales, donde se enfrentan selecciones estatales tras sonar sus respectivos himnos en grandes estadios, pasando por las copas con nombres de reyes y presidentes, pol?tica y f?tbol guardan una inextricable relaci?n desde su nacimiento. Pero ?c?mo es posible que un deporte mueva tantas pasiones? ?Qu? lo ha llevado a lo largo de los tiempos a actuar como detonante de conflictos b?licos, catalizador de revoluciones o transformador social en lugares tan diversos como Espa?a, Jordania, M?xico, Iraq, Ucrania, Argentina o Hong Kong? Con un estilo ameno y gran rigor hist?rico, Toni Padilla nos lleva en un viaje apasionante por los cinco continentes para conocer y entender la geopol?tica del f?tbol a trav?s de las sorprendentes historias de cuarenta clubes, y, de este modo, desentra?ar las complejidades del deporte rey y su impacto pol?tico, social y econ?mico de </p>

Nevertheless Charles Kingshaw and his mother are soon installed and Hooper sets about subtly persecuting the fearful new arrival.

<p>Summary : The daily lives of ordinary people are replete with objects, common things used in commonplace settings. These objects are our constant companions in life. As such, writes Soetsu Yanagi, they should be made with care and built to last, treated with respect and even affection. They should be natural and simple, sturdy and safe &#8211; the aesthetic result of wholeheartedly fulfilling utilitarian needs. They should, in short, be things of beauty.In an age of feeble and ugly machine-made things, these essays call for us to deepen and transform our relationship with the objects that surround us. Inspired by the work of the simple, humble craftsmen Yanagi encountered during his lifelong travels through Japan and Korea, they are an earnest defence of modest, honest, handcrafted things &#8211; from traditional teacups to jars to cloth and paper. Objects like these exemplify the enduring appeal of simplicity and function: the beauty of everyday things.</p>

<p>Summary : Simon can only watch, helpless, as his family is killed and his friends captured by enemy Travelers?men and women who can summon mystical powers from otherworldly Territories. To top it off, another young man from Simon&#8217;s village discovers that he&#8217;s a savior prophesied to destroy evil and save the realm.Prophecy has nothing to say about Simon. He has no special powers, no magical weapons, and no guarantee that he&#8217;ll survive. But he sets off anyway, alone, to gain the power he needs to oppose the Travelers and topple their ruthless Overlord. It may not be his destiny, but Simon&#8217;s determined to rescue his fellow villagers from certain death.Because who cares about prophecy, really?</p>

<p>Summary : Look around and you see tangled lives and unhappy people. Multiply this and you see the pattern of our civilization.

Unnecessary obstacles that discourage students and hinder progress are removed, such as rote memorization of endless verbal paradigms. Instead, students </p>

<p>Summary : Building a route to market is fundamental to sales and survival. This book demystifies marketing channel strategy by focusing on how to do channel design and management. We provide practical tools and frameworks for key decisions and highlight the critical tradeoffs and pitfalls. Many channel strategies are built like the wood towers used in popular stacking games. You hope your tower is sturdy and strong. But over time, you may replace or add partners, add or subtract routes to market, and change your product lines &#8211; so your channel strategy must adapt in order to prevent your tower from collapsing or breaking apart. This Field Guide introduces you to the channels landscape, helps you understand your building block options, and unpacks the physics of adding and subtracting channel components, to give you the tools you need to keep your go-to-market strategy resilient, responsive, and a source of competitive advantage.</p>

<p>Summary : Building a route to market is fundamental to sales and survival. This book demystifies marketing channel strategy by focusing on how to do channel design and management. We provide practical tools and frameworks for key decisions and highlight the critical tradeoffs and pitfalls. Many channel strategies are built like the wood towers used in popular stacking games. You hope your tower is sturdy and strong. But over time, you may replace or add partners, add or subtract routes to market, and change your product lines &#8211; so your channel strategy must adapt in order to prevent your tower from collapsing or breaking apart. This Field Guide introduces you to the channels landscape, helps you understand your building block options, and unpacks the physics of adding and subtracting channel components, to give you the tools you need to keep your go-to-market strategy resilient, responsive, and a source of competitive advantage.</p>

<p>Summary : A collection of compelling quotations from a rising star in contemporary art, architecture, and designThe work of renowned contemporary artist Daniel Arsham blurs the lines between art, architecture, archeology, and design. In his distinctive style, he takes ancient art works and objects from twentieth-century pop culture and casts sculptures of them in geological materials such as quartz or volcanic ash, colliding past, present, and future in haunted yet playful visions that prompt viewers to question their everyday surroundings. Gathered from interviews and other sources, Arsham-isms is a collection of lively, thought-provoking, and memorable quotations from this exciting young creative talent on a wide range of subjects&#8211;including art, architecture, film, design, pop culture, the art world, and what it means to be a globally recognized artist today.Select quotations from the book:&#8221;Art needs to be a little dangerous.&#8221;&#8221;You don&#8217;t have to own the thing to be part of it.&#8221;&#8221;This work for </p>

<p>Summary : It is the middle of the summer, but there is an unseasonal mist pressing against the windowpanes. Harry Potter is waiting nervously in his bedroom at the Dursleys&#8217; house in Privet Drive for a visit from Professor Dumbledore himself. One of the last times he saw the Headmaster, he was in a fierce one-to-one duel with Lord Voldemort, and Harry can&#8217;t quite believe that Professor Dumbledore will actually appear at the Dursleys&#8217; of all places. Why is the Professor coming to visit him now? What is it that cannot wait until Harry returns to Hogwarts in a few weeks&#8217; time? Harry&#8217;s sixth year at Hogwarts has already got off to an unusual start, as the worlds of Muggle and magic start to intertwine&#8230;</p>

<p>Summary : John Habib came back to the faith of his youth in young adulthood after reading an afterlife story handwritten by an Egyptian Christian monk. This book is the culmination of over fifteen years of research on a quest to arrive at what the Orthodox Christian understanding of the afterlife really is. John is an avid student of Christian history and theology, having written several articles and delivered countless lectures on those subjects. He is also an attorney and serves as a reader in the Coptic Orthodox Church.This book delves into a treasure trove of Orthodox history to seek out answers to questions such as the following (and much more):? What is death and what does it feel like to die?? What will our spirits look like?? What will we see immediately after death?? What is the experience after death? Is it a journey, or do we directly find ourselves in some other place?? What is Hades like? Is it really a fiery torment? Is everyone punished the same?? What is Paradise like? How does </p>

Now the story continues in Written in My Own Heart s Blood.  1778: France declares war on Great Britain, the British army leaves Philadelphia, and George Washington s troops leave Valley Forge in pursuit.

<p>Summary : Fans of Princess Posey and Ivy and Bean will enjoy engaging with science-loving Jada Jones in this easy-to-read chapter book.When Jada Jones&#8217;s best friend moves away, school feels like the last place she wants to be. She&#8217;d much rather wander outside looking for cool rocks to add to her collection, since finding rocks is much easier than finding friends. So when Jada&#8217;s teacher announces a class project on rocks and minerals, Jada finally feels like she&#8217;s in her element. The only problem: one of her teammates doesn&#8217;t seem to like any of Jada&#8217;s ideas. She doesn&#8217;t seem to like Jada all that much, either. Can Jada figure out a way to make a winning science project and a new friend? ?The early chapter book bridges between leveled readers and chapter books for fluent readers adjusting to the chapter book format. At about 5,000 words, with short chapters and two-color art on almost every page, it will appeal to this unique reader. The two-color art throughout will help readers transition </p>

<p>Summary : ?Il Vangelo ? pieno di non protagonisti che sono per? essenziali. Questo ? un segno inconfondibile di Dio, il quale preferisce sempre il ?non protagonismo? per realizzare la storia della salvezza. Dio non sceglie mai le cose pi? in vista, tant?? che Ges? non viene al mondo nel palazzo di Erode, sotto i riflettori, ma nasce in una stalla.

Per cui ? indispensabile avere la capacit? di mettere al centro della nostra esistenza ci? che normalmente lasciamo ai margini?.Cos?

<p>Summary : ?Il Vangelo ? pieno di non protagonisti che sono per? essenziali. Questo ? un segno inconfondibile di Dio, il quale preferisce sempre il ?non protagonismo? per realizzare la storia della salvezza.

<p>Summary : Rhodes and Iliana couldn&#8217;t be more different, but that&#8217;s not why they hate each other.Rhodes, a gifted artist, has always excelled at Alabama&#8217;s Conservatory of the Arts (until she&#8217;s hit with a secret bout of creator&#8217;s block), while Iliana, a transfer student, tries to outshine everyone with her intense, competitive work ethic. Since only one of them can get the coveted Capstone scholarship, the competition between them is fierce.They both escape the pressure on a fanfic site where they are unknowingly collaborating on a webcomic. And despite being worst enemies in real life, their anonymous online identities I-Kissed-Alice and Curious-in-Cheshire are starting to like each other&#8230;a lot. When the truth comes out, will they destroy each other&#8217;s future?</p>

<p>Summary : The dark fae king has left me with no choice.  He threatened my guard and my brother. My need to enact revenge for the brutal massacre of my parents is all-encompassing. If he wants war, a war he will receive.  First order of business&#8230; returning to a land and home that I haven&#8217;t seen in years. Will everything have changed? Will the politics of court allow for my shift in policy? Should I enact the Always Punch First rule? Why the hell are there carriages?  My secrets have been laid all out in the open for inspection, but returning home means that my guard are subjected to the same light. Not only do we have to deal with court politics, but family politics as well. Can I even hide my relationship long enough to convince the light fae to stay allies with us?  Will I even make it the coronation? Or will our merry band of lunatics have problems before I can even touch the throne?  The only question I don&#8217;t have? How I will kill the dark fae king.  *** It is not necessary but adds to </p>

<p>Summary : In this sequel to Kerri Maniscalco&#8217;s Stalking Jack the Ripper, bizarre murders are discovered in the castle of Prince Vlad the Impaler, otherwise known as Dracula. Could it be a copycat killer&#8230;or has the depraved prince been brought back to life? Now in paperback!Following the grief and horror of her discovery of Jack the Ripper&#8217;s true identity, Audrey Rose Wadsworth has no choice but to flee London and its memories. Together with the arrogant yet charming Thomas Cresswell, she journeys to the dark heart of Romania, home to one of Europe&#8217;s best schools of forensic medicine&#8230;and to another notorious killer, Vlad the Impaler, whose thirst for blood became legend. But her life&#8217;s dream is soon tainted by blood-soaked discoveries in the halls of the school&#8217;s forbidding castle, and Audrey Rose is compelled to investigate the strangely familiar murders. What she finds brings all her terrifying fears to life once again.</p>

New allies and new enemies emerge as Thorn races to stop a catastrophe that will shake the entire world of Nova Terra.17 hrs. 5 min.</p>

<p>Summary : A magician plays detective when a show girl is murdered in an English resort town in this historical mystery by the Edgar Award-winning author.Brighton, England, 1953. Over the holiday season, Max Mephisto and his daughter Ruby are headlining a variety show at the Brighton Hippodrome. Landing a gig at the city&#8217;s biggest theater is a major achievement, and only slightly marred by the less-than-savory supporting a tableau show of naked &#8220;living statues.&#8221; But when one of the girls goes missing and turns up dead not long after, Max and Ruby realize there&#8217;s something far more sinister than obscenity afoot in the theater.Max&#8217;s good friend DI Edgar Stephens is on the case. As he searches for the killer, he begins to suspect that the girl&#8217;s fatal vanishing act may be related to another case&#8211;the death of a local florist. But just as he&#8217;s narrowing in on the missing link, Ruby goes missing, and he and Max must reach deep into their bag of tricks to find her before it&#8217;s too late.</p>

<p>Summary : Do you ever feel that fortune is not your favor?Do you have a need for powerful protection from your enemies?Do you long for more control over your own destiny?Those who have had the good luck of being born to privilege expect and usually receive leniency, justice and opportunity.

It&#8217;s the way to get control over every aspect of your life in an out-of-control, imbalanced world, to obtain justice when it is lacking and to turn life-long bad luck into good fortune.&#8221;Practical Black Magic: How to Hex and Curse Your Enemies,&#8221; explains how witchcraft powers are obtained and cultivated and gives instructions for attacking enemies and advancing your personal interests while protecting yourself from harm. The final chapter gives specific spells and rituals for cursing and hexing your enemies.</p>
