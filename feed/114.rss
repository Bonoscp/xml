<p>Summary : Ocean&#8217;s Echo is a standalone romantic space adventure, set in the same universe as Everina Maxwell&#8217;s hit debut, Winter&#8217;s Orbit.When Tennal &#8211; a rich socialite, inveterate flirt, and walking disaster &#8211; is caught using his telepathic powers for illegal activities, the military decides to bind his mind to someone whose coercive powers are strong enough to control him.Enter Lieutenant Surit, the child of a disgraced general. Out of a desperate need to restore a pension to his other parent, Lieutenant Surit agrees to be bound to Tennal and keep him conscripted in the army, a task that seems impossible even for someone with Surit&#8217;s ability to control minds.Tennal just wants to escape, but Surit isn&#8217;t all that he seems. And their bond may just be the key to their freedom.</p>

<p>Summary : The Little Prover introduces inductive proofs as a way to determine facts about computer programs. It is written in an approachable, engaging style of question-and-answer, with the characteristic humor of The Little Schemer (fourth edition, MIT Press). Sometimes the best way to learn something is to sit down and do it; the book takes readers through step-by-step examples showing how to write inductive proofs. The Little Prover assumes only knowledge of recursive programs and lists (as presented in the first three chapters of The Little Schemer) and uses only a few terms beyond what novice programmers already know. The book comes with a simple proof assistant to help readers work through the book and complete solutions to every example.</p>

<p>Summary : Philosophy begins with questions about the nature of reality and how we should live. These were the concerns of Socrates, who spent his days in the ancient Athenian marketplace asking awkward questions, disconcerting the people he met by showing them how little they genuinely understood. This engaging book introduces the great thinkers in Western philosophy and explores their most compelling ideas about the world and how best to live in it.In forty brief chapters, Nigel Warburton guides us on a chronological tour of the major ideas in the history of philosophy. He provides interesting and often quirky stories of the lives and deaths of thought-provoking philosophers from Socrates, who chose to die by hemlock poisoning rather than live on without the freedom to think for himself, to Peter Singer, who asks the disquieting philosophical and ethical questions that haunt our own times.Warburton not only makes philosophy accessible, he offers inspiration to think, argue, reason, and ask in </p>

<p>Summary : ?Ho i gironi girati, mannaggia ai guelfi neri!? Questo e altro direbbe oggi il caro vecchio Dante Alighieri facendo il login sui suoi social. Perch? l?arte sar? pure immutabile, ma i poeti no e la loro pazienza ha un limite. In questa versione remastered della sua (sempre pi?) Divina Commedia scopriremo che il tostissimo Poeta toscano non ha perso la propria verve, nonostante vada ormai per i settecento e passa. Da Francesca a Ugolino, passando per Ciacco, Ulisse, e naturalmente Beatrice, ascolteremo le storie dei suoi personaggi pi? celebri. Un viaggio senza esclusione di insulti ai pi? svariati nemici, scortato da un Virgilio che non ce la fa pi? a trascinarsi dietro il ?peso vivo? del Sommo. Tra un?estasi e uno svenimento, procederemo lungo tortuose terzine, ma la parafrasi sar? diversa da come ce la ricordiamo!</p>

In questa versione remastered della sua (sempre pi?) Divina Commedia scopriremo che il tostissimo Poeta toscano non ha perso la propria verve, nonostante vada ormai per i settecento e passa. Da Francesca a Ugolino, passando per Ciacco, Ulisse, e naturalmente Beatrice, ascolteremo le storie dei suoi personaggi pi? celebri. Un viaggio senza esclusione di insulti ai pi? svariati nemici, scortato da un Virgilio che non ce la fa pi? a trascinarsi dietro il ?peso vivo? del Sommo. Tra un?estasi e uno svenimento, procederemo lungo tortuose terzine, ma la parafrasi sar? diversa da come ce la ricordiamo!

<p>Summary : &#8220;Jodo Notebook&#8221; is a fully illustrated manual of the Basic techniques (Kihon) of Shindo Muso Ryu (SMR) and the Zen Nippon Kendo Renmei (ZNKR),and the 12 Kata of Seitei Jodo. It is an invaluable supplement to Jodo training to make learning easier and faster as well.Jodo (Japanese stick fighting) is taught either in Shindo Muso Ryu, or in the Zen Nippon Kendo Renmei under the name Seitei Jodo. Both systems share the same Basics (12 Kihon). The differences are in the Kata (12 in Seitei Jodo, and 64 in SMR), and the training with other weapons arts besides the Jo and the Sword (Tachi) in Shindo Muso Ryu (in the 64 SMR Kata). The ZNKR Jodo organization is by far the largest international Jodo organization.Very few books are available on Jodo. Jodo is taught worldwide, but newer literature in English is hard to get. Most of the literature is in Japanese.The Notebook is made to fill this gap in literature.The author is co-writer with George W. Alexander of The Dictionary of Japanese Martial </p>

<p>Summary : Helen Vaughan doesn&#8217;t know why she and her mother left their ancestral home at Harrowstone Hall, called Harrow, or why they haven&#8217;t spoken to their extended family since. So when her grandfather dies, she&#8217;s shocked to learn that he has left everything?the house, the grounds, and the money?to her. The inheritance comes with one condition: she must stay on the grounds of Harrow for one full year, or she&#8217;ll be left with nothing. There is more at stake than money. For as long as she can remember, Harrow has haunted Helen&#8217;s dreams?and now those dreams have become a waking nightmare. Helen knows that if she is going to survive the year, she needs to uncover the secrets of Harrow. Why is the house built like a labyrinth? What is digging the holes that appear in the woods each night? And why does the house itself seem to be making her sick? With each twisted revelation, Helen questions what she knows about Harrow, her family, and even herself. She no longer wonders if she wants to leave?but </p>

<p>Summary : Helen Vaughan doesn&#8217;t know why she and her mother left their ancestral home at Harrowstone Hall, called Harrow, or why they haven&#8217;t spoken to their extended family since. So when her grandfather dies, she&#8217;s shocked to learn that he has left everything?the house, the grounds, and the money?to her. The inheritance comes with one condition: she must stay on the grounds of Harrow for one full year, or she&#8217;ll be left with nothing. There is more at stake than money.

With each twisted revelation, Helen questions what she knows about Harrow, her family, and even herself. She no longer wonders if she wants to leave?but </p>

<p>Summary : Ohne Angst sind wir wirklich freiWir alle kennen das Gef?hl der Angst, oft sogar als t?glichen Begleiter. Unsere Vergangenheit belastet uns, die Zukunft f?rchten wir, ebenso Krankheit, Alter und Tod oder den Verlust von Menschen, die uns wichtig sind. Der Zenmeister und buddhistische M?nch Thich Nhat Hanh beschreibt einen Weg, unsere ?ngste loszulassen und damit zugleich im Hier und Jetzt anzukommen. Es ist die Achtsamkeit, die uns durch die Angst ? und ins Jetzt tr?gt. Thich Nhat Hanh zeigt, wie wir uns unserer Angst bewusst werden, sie annehmen und ihre Herkunft erkennen ? und ihr dadurch die Macht ?ber uns nehmen. Dadurch sind wir in der Lage, das Sch?ne und Bejahende in uns und um uns herum jeden Tag aufs Neue zu erleben.</p>

<p>Summary : On a dark and stormy night, two mysterious women invade an unnamed narrator&#8217;s house, where they proceed to ruthlessly question their host&#8217;s gender and identity. The increasingly frantic protagonist fails to defend his supposed masculinity and eventually finds himself in a sanatorium. A Gothic tale of destabilized male-female binaries and subverted literary tropes, this is the book&#8217;s first English publication.</p>

<p>Summary : Estate 1942. Alla stazione di Nonantola, in provincia di Modena, scendono quaranta ragazzi e bambini ebrei. Sono scappati dalla Germania nazista grazie all&#8217;organizzazione di Recha Freier e, con i loro accompagnatori, stanno cercando di arrivare in Palestina, ma la guerra li ha costretti a continui cambi di direzione: prima la Croazia, poi la Slovenia, ora l&#8217;Italia. A Nonantola vengono sistemati appena fuori dal paese, a Villa Emma. Sembra che il peggio sia passato. Ci sono lezioni, assemblee e i pi? grandi imparano mestieri che un giorno potrebbero essere utili. Tra i ragazzi e le ragazze di Villa Emma c&#8217;? anche Natan, che inizialmente vede tutta questa attenzione con sospetto. Bruciano ancora il ricordo del padre trascinato via nella notte, l&#8217;addio della madre e del fratello pi? piccolo. Eppure, a Villa Emma non ci sono stelle gialle da appuntare al cappotto, n? ghetti, n? retate nella notte. Sembra di essere in un mondo completamente nuovo, dove i contadini portano cibo, il </p>

<p>Summary : The storm had been brewing for days and now it hits! Combined with restless, idle youth and the desire for easy money, something has been released out there amid the darkness, the howling wind, and lashing rain.Dead Light is an adventure scenario for the Call of Cthulhu roleplaying system designed to be played in one or more gaming sessions. An exercise in Lovecraftian-flavored survival horror, the unwitting investigators are caught up in a spiral of terror where only their quick thinking, and courage, will see them through till the clouds clear and a new dawn beckons.Suitable as a stand alone adventure or as a sidetrack within a larger campaign, Dead Light is set in Lovecraft Country, north of Arkham, during the early 1920s and is ideal for groups of between three to six players.This is one journey your players will not soon forget.</p>

<p>Summary : Twin sisters, both on the run, but different as day and night. One, a professional rogue, searches for a fabled treasure; the other, a changeling, searches for the truth behind her origins, trying to find a place to fit in with the realm of fae who made her and the humans who shun her.? Iselia &#8220;Seelie&#8221; Graygrove looks just like her twin, Isolde&#8230; but as an autistic changeling trying to navigate her unpredictable magic, Seelie finds it more difficult to fit in with the humans around her. When Seelie and Isolde are caught up in a heist gone wrong and make some unexpected allies, they find themselves unraveling a larger mystery that has its roots in the history of humans and fae alike. ?Both sisters soon discover that the secrets of the faeries may be more valuable than any pile of gold and jewels. But can Seelie harness her magic in time to protect her sister, and herself?</p>

<p>Summary : My new neighbor is a total tool.He hated me from the second he laid eyes on me, and I don?t have the first clue why? But, if he wants to hate me, I?m happy to give him a few reasons: mowing the lawn at dawn on the weekend, leaving garbage cans in front of his driveway, renting a petting zoo for my backyard&#8230;making a list of ways to drive him crazy is half the fun.He deserves it with the way he?s driving me crazy right back without even trying? walking around without a shirt on, sweaty rippling muscles on full display, well-worn denim jeans perfectly molded to his&#8230;well, you get the idea.My point is, if he wants a war, I?ll give him one.***Nailed is an enemies to lovers, neighbors who can&#8217;t stand each other, omg the anger banging, drool worthy, low angst story, which happens to be the second in my Four Bears Construction Series. It CAN be read as a stand alone. There are NO shifters in this series, only the OTHER kind of bears.</p>

<p>Summary : I came here with a single goal in mind.An aim.A purpose.I will break out of Darkmore Penitentiary.But I was a fool to think that it would be so simple.And now with more and more Fae relying on me to get them out of this slice of hell, I find myself unable to do a damn thing.Mason Cain stabbed me in the back and left me to rot in the dark. So now I have another goal in mind before I escape this place, because no one messes with the Queen of the Oscura Clan and lives to tell the tale. The moment I get out of here, my sights will be set on him.Between the four alpha males luring me in, the psychopaths trying to kill me and the monster roaming the halls at night, I have my hands full in here.But one thing is for sure.I?m not throwing my life away in this place. So I?ll do whatever it takes to escape.This is a dark, hot paranormal romance series where the main character will end up with more than one male love interest. The series is set in the same world as Zodiac Academy and Dark Fae, </p>

<p>Summary : Autumn. Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness. Two old friends?Daniel, a centenarian, and Elisabeth, born in 1984?look to both the future and the past as the United Kingdom stands divided by a historic, once-in-a-generation summer. Love is won, love is lost. Hope is hand-in-hand with hopelessness. The seasons roll round, as ever.?A luminous meditation on the meaning of richness and harvest and worth,?Autumn?is the first installment of Ali Smith?s Seasonal Quartet, and it casts an eye over our own time: Who are we? What are we made of? Shakespearean jeu d?esprit, Keatsian melancholy, the sheer bright energy of 1960s pop art. Autumn is wide-ranging in time-scale and light-footed through histories.</p>

<p>Summary : An unflinching, darkly funny, and deeply moving story of a boy, his seriously ill mother, and an unexpected monstrous visitor.At seven minutes past midnight, thirteen-year-old Conor wakes to find a monster outside his bedroom window. But it isn&#8217;t the monster Conor&#8217;s been expecting&#8211; he&#8217;s been expecting the one from his nightmare, the nightmare he&#8217;s had nearly every night since his mother started her treatments. The monster in his backyard is different. It&#8217;s ancient. And wild. And it wants something from Conor. Something terrible and dangerous. It wants the truth. From the final idea of award-winning author Siobhan Dowd&#8211; whose premature death from cancer prevented her from writing it herself&#8211; Patrick Ness has spun a haunting and darkly funny novel of mischief, loss, and monsters both real and imagined.</p>

<p>Summary : A collection of more than 100 recipes that introduces Japanese comfort food to American home cooks, exploring new ingredients, techniques, and the surprising origins of popular dishes like gyoza and tempura.?????Japanese food is often thought of as precise, austere, and time-consuming. But along with the high (kaiseki and tea ceremony) there is also the low (food carts and fried chicken). Through recipes, fascinating narrative, and lush location photography, Tadashi Ono and Harris Salat explore Japan&#8217;s long history of homey fare, which has now firmly taken root in the US. Some of the dishes are already loved here, like ramen, soba, tempura, and gyoza, but others, like Japanese-style fried chicken, rice bowls and okonomiyaki, and savory pancakes, will be deliciously delightful surprises, perfect for a weeknight meal or weekend entertaining.</p>

<p>Summary : Mark and Giulia?s life together began as a storybook romance. They fell in love at eighteen, married at twenty-four, and were living their dream life in San Francisco. When Giulia was twenty-seven, she suffered a terrifying and unexpected psychotic break that landed her in the psych ward for nearly a month. One day she was vibrant and well-adjusted; the next she was delusional and suicidal, convinced that her loved ones were not safe.A story of the fragility of the mind and the tenacity of the human spirit, My Lovely Wife in the Psych Ward is, above all, a love story that raises profound questions: How do we care for the people we love? What and whom do we live for?</p>

<p>Summary : Why are we all taught maths for years of our lives? Does it really empower everyone? Or fail most and disenfranchise many? Is it crucial for the AI age or an obsolete rite of passage?The Math(s) Fix: An Education Blueprint for the AI Age is a groundbreaking book that exposes why maths education is in crisis worldwide and how the only fix is a fundamentally new mainstream subject. It argues that today&#8217;s maths education is not working to elevate society with modern computation, data science and AI. Instead, students are subjugated to compete with what computers do best, and lose.This is the only book to explain why being bad at maths may be as much the subject&#8217;s fault as the learner&#8217;s: how a stuck educational ecosystem has students, parents, teachers, schools, employers and policymakers running in the wrong direction to catch up with real-world requirements. But it goes further too, for the first time setting out a completely alternative vision for a core computational school subject </p>

But before they can set foot on the Throneworld, they must first break the defences of the Sol System. Powerful fleets and cunning defences bar their path ? but can anything hope to halt the advance of the Traitor armada?READ IT BECAUSEThe final act of the long-running, bestselling series starts here, with a brutal and uncompromising look at the first stage of the Siege of Terra, the war to conquer the solar system. Armies will fall, heroes will rise and legends will be written?THE STORYAfter seven years of bitter war, the end has come at last for the conflict known infamously as the Horus Heresy. Terra now lies within the Warmaster?s sights, the Throneworld and the seat of his father?s rule.

<p>Summary : It was one of the most searing images of the twentieth century: two young boys, two princes, walking behind their mother&#8217;s coffin as the world watched in sorrow&#8211;and horror. As Diana, Princess of Wales, was laid to rest, billions wondered what the princes must be thinking and feeling&#8211;and how their lives would play out from that point on.For Harry, this is that story at last.With its raw, unflinching honesty, Spare is a landmark publication full of insight, revelation, self-examination, and hard-won wisdom about the eternal power of love over grief.</p>

<p>Summary : Tackling some of the world&#8217;s most profound questions through the intimate lens of fatherhood, Bayo Akomolafe embarks on a journey of discovery as he maps the contours of the spaces between himself and his three-year-old daughter, Alethea. In a narrative that manages to be both intricate and unguarded, he discovers that something as commonplace as becoming a father is a cosmic event of unprecedented proportions. Using this realization as a touchstone, he is led to consider the strangeness of his own soul, contemplate the myths and rituals of modernity, ask questions about food and justice, ponder what it means to be human, evaluate what we can do about climate change, and wonder what our collective yearnings for a better world tell us about ourselves. These Wilds Beyond Our Fences is a passionate attempt to make sense of our disconnection in a world where it is easy to feel untethered and lost. It is a father&#8217;s search for meaning, for a place of belonging, and for reassurance that the </p>

<p>Summary : This excellent new edition continues the legacy of the previous ten editions of Sports in Society. Combining the original structure with new material, the authors introduce research and discussion which encompasses a global view of the sociology of sport. The sociology of sport is a sub-discipline of sociology that studies sports as part of social and cultural life. Sensitive topics, such as religion, have been integrated throughout the text to provide a holistic view of society. Drawing on a number of contemporary issues, terms and debates in sports, the authors use a range of specific cases to bring theory to life.</p>

<p>Summary : How a grim diagnosis transformed the life of one of Australia&#8217;s top cancer specialists.It was a cruel twist of fate: in November 2006 Chris O&#8217;Brien, one of Australia&#8217;s leading head and neck cancer surgeons, was diagnosed with an aggressive and almost inevitably lethal form of brain cancer. As he knew, few sufferers survive past twelve months. Nevertheless, he was determined to beat the odds. With the support of his close family, O&#8217;Brien took the option of radical brain surgery under the supervision of well-known neurosurgeon Dr Charlie Teo. His health and relative youth &#8211; he was fifty-four when diagnosed &#8211; helped him with the painful transition from doctor to patient, and renewed his faith in the importance of an optimistic outlook as the cornerstone of recovery.Here, in his bestselling memoir, Chris O&#8217;Brien looked back over his life and the forces that shaped him &#8211; from his modest beginnings and early years as a doctor to becoming the face of the television show RPA, and from his </p>

<p>Summary : When so many enterprises have the strategic goal of maximizing product value to customers, changing their project management office (PMO) into a value management office (VMO) will help them do it. Because of the widespread adoption of agile methods in organizations, there is a rapidly growing shift from a focus on projects to one on products. This shift brings dramatic changes in how organizations manage and deliver not only IT services but their entire product and service value streams. Whatever methodology is being implemented, success at all levels is inextricably linked back to a clear understanding of customer value and customer-driven outcomes across teams.This book shows program and project managers how to maximize their professional relevancy in this new world. They must shift from being program managers to value managers, maximizing value through the entire organization. This book defines the role and skills of the value manager, using case studies and step-by-step guidance </p>

<p>Summary : The German sociologist Max Weber is one of the most venturesome, stimulating, and influential theorists of the modern condition. Among his most significant works are the so-called vocation lectures, published shortly after the end of World War I and delivered at the invitation of a group of student activists. The question the students asked Weber to address was simple and haunting: In a modern world characterized by the division of labor, economic expansion, and unrelenting change, was it still possible to consider an academic or political career as a genuine calling? In response Weber offered his famous diagnosis of ?the disenchantment of the world,? along with a challenging account of the place of morality in the classroom and in research. In his second lecture he introduced the notion of political charisma, assigning it a central role in the modern state, even as he recognized that politics is more than anything ?a slow and difficult drilling of holes into hard boards.?Damion </p>

<p>Summary : To repay his debt to Shal, Randidly Ghosthound fought his way through the preliminaries of the Under-25 Regional Tournament in Tellus.His victories have earned him a spot in Deardun, the seat of power in the Northern Domain. But in this new venue, there are storms brewing on the horizon. Now he?s not just fighting against the unaffiliated warriors, one injury or loss away from becoming a Forsaken.The affluent Styles that rule the Northern Domain have passed the championship between each other over the last five decades, and they aren?t willing to surrender it now.Yet an even larger shadow looms on the horizon.Representatives from the autocratic Central Domain have infiltrated the tournament, looking for clues about an old mystery: the true story of the Shal?s father, the original Spear Phantom. And the location of the third gift he received from the Witch of Karma, Lucretia.</p>

<p>Summary : Fireflies tells the story of Trinidad&#8217;s most venerated Hindu family, the Khojas. Rigidly orthodox, presiding over acres of ill-kept sugarcane and hoards of jewellery enthusiastically guarded by old Mrs. Khoja, they seem to have triumphed more by default than by anything else. Only &#8216;Baby&#8217; Khoja, who is parcelled off into an arranged marriage with a bus driver, proves an exception to this rule. She is the heroine, and her story the single gleaming thread in Shiva Naipaul&#8217;s ferociously comic and profoundly sad first novel.</p>

<p>Summary : In Backwoods Witchcraft, Jake Richards offers up a folksy stew of family stories, lore, omens, rituals, and conjure crafts that he learned from his great-grandmother, his grandmother, and his grandfather, a Baptist minister who Jake remembers could &#8220;rid someone of a fever with an egg or stop up the blood in a wound.&#8221; The witchcraft practiced in Appalachia is very much a folk magic of place, a tradition that honors the seen and unseen beings that inhabit the land as well as the soil, roots, and plant life.The materials and tools used in Appalachia witchcraft are readily available from the land. This &#8220;grounded approach&#8221; will be of keen interest to witches and conjure folk regardless of where they live. Readers will be guided in how to build relationships with the spirits and other beings that dwell around them and how to use the materials and tools that are readily available on the land where one lives.This book also provides instructions on how to create a working space and altar and </p>

<p>Summary : Menopausing is more than just a book, it?s a movement. An uprising. Menopause affects every woman, and yet so many approach it with shame, fear, misinformation or silence.Why is no one talking about this? Who has the correct information? And how can we get it?That?s how this book has come about. We are going to tell you the truth, so you can make an informed decision about your life and your body.For too long, women have had to keep quiet about the menopause?its onset, its symptoms, its treatments?and what it means for us. Menopausing will build an empowered, supportive community to break this terrible silence once and for all. By exploring and explaining the science, debunking damaging myths, and smashing the taboos around the perimenopause and menopause, this book will equip women to make the most informed decisions about their health?and their lives.Menopausing will also celebrate the sharing of stories, enabling women to feel less alone and more understood, and talk openly and </p>

<p>Summary : Menopausing is more than just a book, it?s a movement. An uprising. Menopause affects every woman, and yet so many approach it with shame, fear, misinformation or silence.Why is no one talking about this? Who has the correct information?

<p>Summary : Die bekannte Wissenschaftsjournalistin Dr. Mai Thi Nguyen-Kim untersucht mit analytischem Scharfsinn und unbestechlicher Logik brennende Streitfragen unserer Gesellschaft. Mit Fakten und wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnissen kontert sie Halbwahrheiten, Fakes und Verschw?rungsmythen ? und zeigt, wo wir uns mangels Beweisen noch zurecht munter streiten d?rfen.Themen:Die Legalisierung von Drogen, Videospiele, Gewalt, Gender Pay Gap, systemrelevante Berufe, Care-Arbeit, Lohngerechtigkeit, Big Pharma vs. Alternative Medizin, Hom?opathie, klinische Studien, Impfpflicht, die Erblichkeit von Intelligenz, Gene vs. Umwelt, m?nnliche und weibliche Gehirne, Tierversuche und von Corona bis Klimawandel: Wie politisch darf Wissenschaft sein?Fakten, wissenschaftlich fundiert und eindeutig belegt, sind Gold wert. Gerade dann, wenn in Gesellschaft und Politik ?ber Reizthemen hitzig gestritten wird, braucht es einen Faktencheck, um die Dinge klarzustellen und Irrt?mer und Fakes aus der Welt schaffen.

<p>Summary : &#8220;The best Vietnam War novels yet for this age range.&#8221; &#8211; KIRKUS REVIEWSMorris, Rudi, Ivan, and Beck were best friends. So when one of them was drafted into the Vietnam War, the others signed up, too. They promised to watch out for one another. They pledged to come home together.Now, that pledge has been broken. One of the four has been killed in action. And the remaining three are the only men alive who know the awful truth about their friend&#8217;s death.Each is left to deal with their secret in his own way. One of them will accompany his friend&#8217;s body home to Boston. One of them will defy orders in an act of protest. And one of them will decide it&#8217;s up to him to single-handedly win the war.In the end, Vietnam may claim more than their lives. As the war grinds on, their very souls are at stake. And their shattered friendship will prove either their salvation . . . or their ruin.</p>

<p>Summary : About the BookIts thirty-six years after the Great War of Kurukshetra. The curse of a bereaved mother has deprived Krishna of everything, except his life. And so he journeys to Vrindavan, the village of his innocence, to spend the concluding hours of his life with his childhood friend and lover, Radha. In her presence, Krishna peels off the layers of myth that portrayed him as the incarnation of God. And at her request, he retells the story of the Mahabharata, like you have never heard before. All lies, says Krishna is an emotional journey into the tortured inner universe of its central characters, focusing more on their flailings than on their heroism. A charismatic retelling of the Mahabharata, this compellingly told narrative has a distinctive voice which sets it apart from anything you have ever read.About the AuthorJ.

<p>Olivia Fox Cabane helps some of the world&#8217;s best-known people become more charismatic. Here she breaks charisma down into its fundamental components, revealing the secrets to how it works.

<p>Summary : 12 hrs 20 minsA stunning new novel from the number-one New York Times best-selling author &#8211; an epic of hope and horror, chaos and magic, and a journey that will unite a desperate group of people to fight the battle of their lives&#8230;It began on New Year?s Eve.The sickness came on suddenly, and spread quickly. The fear spread even faster. Within weeks, everything people counted on began to fail them. The electrical grid sputtered; law and government collapsed?and more than half of the world?s population was decimated.Where there had been order, there was now chaos. And as the power of science and technology receded, magic rose up in its place. Some of it is good, like the witchcraft worked by Lana Bingham, practicing in the loft apartment she shares with her lover, Max. Some of it is unimaginably evil, and it can lurk anywhere, around a corner, in fetid tunnels beneath the river?or in the ones you know and love the most.As word spreads that neither the immune nor the gifted are safe </p>

A sweet little girl named Birdie Maxwell who?d written to the magazine that I worked for.You see, once a year, my employer fulfilled a few wishes for readers. Only that column didn?t start up again for months.So I fulfilled some of her wishes myself. It was harmless? or so I thought. Until one day I took things too far.While anonymously granting yet another of Birdie?s wishes, I got a look at her father.?Her devastatingly handsome, single dad father.?I should have stopped playing fairy godmother then. I should have left well enough alone. But I just couldn?t help myself. I had a connection to this girl. One that had me acting irrationally.Like showing up on their doorstep.From?New York Times?bestselling authors Vi Keeland and Penelope Ward comes a love story about taking chances, and the surprises that come with them.</p>

<p>Summary : In the tradition of Mira Grant and Stephen Graham Jones, Malcolm Devlin?s And Then I Woke Up is a creepy, layered, literary story about false narratives and their ability to divide us.In a world reeling from an unusual plague, monsters lurk in the streets while terrified survivors arm themselves and roam the countryside in packs. Or perhaps something very different is happening. When a disease affects how reality is perceived, it?s hard to be certain of anything?Spence is one of the ?cured? living at the Ironside rehabilitation facility. Haunted by guilt, he refuses to face the changed world until a new inmate challenges him to help her find her old crew. But if he can?t tell the truth from the lies, how will he know if he has earned the redemption he dreams of? How will he know he hasn?t just made things worse?</p>

<p>Summary : Set in Derry, Northern Ireland in the 1990s, Derry Girls is a candid, one-of-a-kind comedy about what it&#8217;s like to be a teenage girl living amongst conflict.It&#8217;s a time of armed police in armoured Land Rovers and British Army check points. But it&#8217;s also the time of Murder, She Wrote, The Cranberries, Salt-N-Pepa, Doc Martens and The X Files. And while The Troubles may hang over her hometown, Erin has troubles of her own, like the fact that the boy she&#8217;s in love with (actually in LOVE with) doesn&#8217;t know she exists. Or that her Ma and Aunt Sarah make her include her weirdo cousin Orla in everything she does. Or that head teacher Sister Michael refuses to acknowledge Erin as a literary genius. Not to mention the fact that her second best friend has ALMOST had sex, whereas Erin&#8217;s never even kissed anyone yet. These are Erin&#8217;s Troubles.Described by the Guardian as &#8216;daft, profane and absolutely brilliant&#8217;, by the New Statesman as &#8216;pitch-perfect&#8217; and by i-D as &#8216;the greatest show on British </p>

<p>Summary : Rizzoli &amp; Isles are back! Jane and Maura are investigating a brutal murder with dire implications, and this time, with Jane&#8217;s intrepid mother, Angela, looking into a mystery of her own.Mothers know best . . .

<p>Summary : Every summer, Rose goes with her mom and dad to a lake house in Awago Beach. It&#8217;s their getaway, their refuge. Rosie&#8217;s friend Windy is always there, too, like the little sister she never had. But this summer is different. Rose&#8217;s mom and dad won&#8217;t stop fighting, and when Rose and Windy seek a distraction from the drama, they find themselves with a whole new set of problems. It&#8217;s a summer of secrets and sorrow and growing up, and it&#8217;s a good thing Rose and Windy have each other.In This One Summer two stellar creators redefine the teen graphic novel. Cousins Mariko and Jillian Tamaki, the team behind Skim, have collaborated on this gorgeous, heartbreaking, and ultimately hopeful story about a girl on the cusp of her teen age?a story of renewal and revelation.</p>

In the past five years, AI has shown it can learn games like chess in mere hours&#8211;and beat humans every time.

<p>Summary : Liz Truss?s journey from schoolgirl revolutionary to Britain?s new prime minister.She is the longest-serving member of the Cabinet, but Britain?s new prime minister is virtually unknown to millions of voters. Written off, mocked and undermined by even her closest colleagues, Liz Truss has slowly but determinedly taken over 10 Downing Street.With unrivalled access and insight, award-winning political journalists Harry Cole and James Heale chart the rise of the geeky teenage Lib Dem who transformed into the queen of the Brexiteers. They track her journey through some of the most powerful jobs in Cabinet and an unexpected rebranding from wonkish Tory loyalist to free-wheeling Instagram star.For the first time, Liz?s closest friends and supporters, as well as her worst critics and rivals, paint the true picture of Britain?s third female prime minister.</p>

<p>Summary : Isha is a girl who loves animals, but struggles in the confines of school. When she is sent away to live with her grandparents on the Indian countryside, she discovers a sacred grove where a young Bengal tiger has taken refuge. Isha knows that the ever-shrinking forests of India mean there are few places left for a tiger to hide. When the local villagers also discover the tiger, Isha finds herself embroiled in a life or death cultural controversy. Isha&#8217;s crusade to save the tiger becomes the catalyst of an arduous journey of awakening and survival across the changing landscape of modernizing India. Her encounters with tribal people, elephants, and her search for the wild jungle are the source of her revelations about the human relationship to the natural world in a gripping story of determination, discovery, and coming of age.</p>

<p>Summary : Isha is a girl who loves animals, but struggles in the confines of school. When she is sent away to live with her grandparents on the Indian countryside, she discovers a sacred grove where a young Bengal tiger has taken refuge. Isha knows that the ever-shrinking forests of India mean there are few places left for a tiger to hide. When the local villagers also discover the tiger, Isha finds herself embroiled in a life or death cultural controversy. Isha&#8217;s crusade to save the tiger becomes the catalyst of an arduous journey of awakening and survival across the changing landscape of modernizing India. Her encounters with tribal people, elephants, and her search for the wild jungle are the source of her revelations about the human relationship to the natural world in a gripping story of determination, discovery, and coming of age.</p>

<p>Summary : After the tragic death of his beloved musician father, fourteen-year-old Benny Oh begins to hear voices. The voices belong to the things in his house &#8211; a sneaker, a broken Christmas ornament, a piece of wilted lettuce. Although Benny doesn&#8217;t understand what these things are saying, he can sense their emotional tone; some are pleasant, a gentle hum or coo, but others are snide, angry and full of pain. When his mother develops a hoarding problem, the voices grow more clamorous.At first Benny tries to ignore them, but soon the voices follow him outside the house, onto the street and at school, driving him at last to seek refuge in the silence of a large public library, where objects are well-behaved and know to speak in whispers. There, Benny discovers a strange new world, where &#8216;things happen&#8217;. He falls in love with a mesmerising street artist with a smug pet ferret, who uses the library as her performance space. He meets a homeless philosopher-poet, who encourages him to ask important </p>

<p>Summary : Duration: 24:13:05Legendary storyteller Stephen King goes deep into the well of his imagination in this spellbinding novel about a seventeen-year-old boy who inherits the keys to a parallel world where good and evil are at war, and the stakes could not be higher?for their world or ours. Charlie Reade looks like a regular high school kid, great at baseball and football, a decent student. But he carries a heavy load. His mom was killed in a hit-and-run accident when he was ten, and grief drove his dad to drink. Charlie learned how to take care of himself?and his dad. Then, when Charlie is seventeen, he meets Howard Bowditch, a recluse with a big dog in a big house at the top of a big hill. In the backyard is a locked shed from which strange sounds emerge, as if some creature is trying to escape. When Mr. Bowditch dies, he leaves Charlie the house, a massive amount of gold, a cassette tape telling a story that is impossible to believe, and a responsibility far too massive for a boy to </p>

<p>Summary : Duration: 24:13:05Legendary storyteller Stephen King goes deep into the well of his imagination in this spellbinding novel about a seventeen-year-old boy who inherits the keys to a parallel world where good and evil are at war, and the stakes could not be higher?for their world or ours. Charlie Reade looks like a regular high school kid, great at baseball and football, a decent student. But he carries a heavy load. His mom was killed in a hit-and-run accident when he was ten, and grief drove his dad to drink. Charlie learned how to take care of himself?and his dad.

When Mr. Bowditch dies, he leaves Charlie the house, a massive amount of gold, a cassette tape telling a story that is impossible to believe, and a responsibility far too massive for a boy to </p>

<p>Summary : A SERVANT blackmailed into becoming a princess?s decoy.A BODYGUARD determined to keep her alive. A PRINCE forced to execute his father?s brutal laws.A PRISONER used to keep him compliant. A WORLD on the brink of war. In one horrible night, Clare goes from kitchen maid to royal decoy.

<p>Summary : This celebrated narrative shows how a teacher, alongside his 5th-grade students, co-created a curriculum based on the students&#8217; needs, interests, and questions. Follow Brian Schultz and his students from a Chicago housing project as they work together to develop an emergent and authentic curriculum based on what is most important to the 5th-graders&#8211;replacing their dilapidated school. The persuasive storytelling that captured the attention of educators and the media depicts the journey of one teacher in an urban school and his students juxtaposed against the powerful and entrenched bureaucracy of Chicago&#8217;s public education system. In this second edition, Schultz examines how school reform continues to fail students in urban contexts, reflects on his teaching and writing from a decade ago, and offers compelling updates on students and what became of the school. A lot can be learned from the young people of Room 405, then and now. Not only did these particular 5th-graders push back </p>

<p>Summary : This celebrated narrative shows how a teacher, alongside his 5th-grade students, co-created a curriculum based on the students&#8217; needs, interests, and questions. Follow Brian Schultz and his students from a Chicago housing project as they work together to develop an emergent and authentic curriculum based on what is most important to the 5th-graders&#8211;replacing their dilapidated school. The persuasive storytelling that captured the attention of educators and the media depicts the journey of one teacher in an urban school and his students juxtaposed against the powerful and entrenched bureaucracy of Chicago&#8217;s public education system. In this second edition, Schultz examines how school reform continues to fail students in urban contexts, reflects on his teaching and writing from a decade ago, and offers compelling updates on students and what became of the school. A lot can be learned from the young people of Room 405, then and now. Not only did these particular 5th-graders push back </p>

<p>Summary : Russia?s epic and dramatic story told in an accessible, lively and short form, using the country&#8217;s fascinating history to illuminate its future.?A country with no natural borders, no single ethnic group, no true central identity, Russia has mythologized its past to unite its people and to signal strength to outsiders. Mark Galeotti takes us behind the myths to the heart of the Russian story: the formation of a nation through its early legends including Ivan the Terrible and Catherine the Great the rise and fall of the Romanovs, the Russian Revolution, the Cold War, Chernobyl and the Soviet Union the arrival of an obscure politician named Vladimir Putin.A Short History of Russia explores the history of this fascinating, glorious, desperate and exasperating country through two intertwined issues: the way successive influences from beyond its borders have shaped Russia, and the way Russians came to terms with this influence, writing and rewriting their past to understand their present </p>

<p>Summary : Russia?s epic and dramatic story told in an accessible, lively and short form, using the country&#8217;s fascinating history to illuminate its future.?A country with no natural borders, no single ethnic group, no true central identity, Russia has mythologized its past to unite its people and to signal strength to outsiders. Mark Galeotti takes us behind the myths to the heart of the Russian story: the formation of a nation through its early legends including Ivan the Terrible and Catherine the Great the rise and fall of the Romanovs, the Russian Revolution, the Cold War, Chernobyl and the Soviet Union the arrival of an obscure politician named Vladimir Putin.A Short History of Russia explores the history of this fascinating, glorious, desperate and exasperating country through two intertwined issues: the way successive influences from beyond its borders have shaped Russia, and the way Russians came to terms with this influence, writing and rewriting their past to understand their present </p>

<p>Summary : Gifted storyteller and bestselling historian H. W. Brands narrates the epic struggle over slavery as embodied by John Brown and Abraham Lincoln&#8211;two men moved to radically different acts to confront our nation&#8217;s gravest sin.John Brown was a charismatic and deeply religious man who heard the God of the Old Testament speaking to him, telling him to destroy slavery by any means. When Congress opened Kansas territory to slavery in 1854, Brown raised a band of followers to wage war. His men tore pro-slavery settlers from their homes and hacked them to death with broadswords. Three years later, Brown and his men assaulted the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia, hoping to arm slaves with weapons for a race war that would cleanse the nation of slavery.Brown&#8217;s violence pointed ambitious Illinois lawyer and former officeholder Abraham Lincoln toward a different solution to slavery: politics.

<p>Summary : This volume in the Springer Series in Social Psychology explores the nature and functions of anger, addressing such questions as: why do people become angry? at whom? how often? and to what effect? In addition to drawing upon biological, historical, legal, cross-cultural, clinical, and social-psychological sources, Anger and Aggression: An Essay on Emotion presents a wealth of new data on the everyday experience of anger, both from the angry person&#8217;s and the target&#8217;s point of view. Comparisons also are made between anger and related emotions, between short-term and long-term anger, and between anger as experienced by men and women.In contrast to most traditional theories of emotion, the author describes anger principally as a socially constructed syndrome, focusing on the functions that anger and related syndromes serve within social systems. On a broader theoretical level, this volume uses anger as a paradigm for the study of emotion in general, making the book of interest to a wide </p>

<p>Summary : Un paseo nost?lgico por los peque?os comercios tradicionales de Tokio a trav?s de preciosas ilustraciones en acuarela. Edici?n biling?e espa?ol-japon?s a todo color. Las acuarelas de este ?lbum presentan una gu?a de las tiendecitas y restaurantes m?s retro y encantadores de Tokio. Rincones de gran belleza, para los que parece que se ha detenido el tiempo, pero que a la vez est?n desapareciendo, engullidos por la moderna capital. Un libro lleno de detalles curiosos sobre la cultura y la arquitectura japonesas, que tambi?n incluye mapas y una explicaci?n detallada sobre los materiales y el proceso creativo de las ilustraciones.</p>

Nobody remembers when it started; rain on the western seaboard is a condition of living. But now ? just as Father Coffey proclaims the coming of the electricity ? the rain clouds are lifting. Seventeen-year-old Noel Crowe is idling in the unexpected sunshine when Christy makes his first entrance into Faha, bringing secrets he needs to atone for. Though he can&#8217;t explain it, Noel knows right then: something has changed. As the people of Faha anticipate the endlessly procrastinated advent of the electricity, and Noel navigates his own coming-of-age and his fallings in and out of love, Christy&#8217;s past gradually comes to light, casting a new glow on a small world. Harking back to a simpler time, This Is Happiness is a tender </p>

Seventeen-year-old Noel Crowe is idling in the unexpected sunshine when Christy makes his first entrance into Faha, bringing secrets he needs to atone for. Though he can&amp;#8217;t explain it, Noel knows right then: something has changed. As the people of Faha anticipate the endlessly procrastinated advent of the electricity, and Noel navigates his own coming-of-age and his fallings in and out of love, Christy&amp;#8217;s past gradually comes to light, casting a new glow on a small world.

<p>Summary : He&#8217;s b-a-a-ack! Despite their best efforts, Carter and Sadie Kane can&#8217;t seem to keep Apophis, the chaos snake, down. Now Apophis is threatening to plunge the world into eternal darkness, and the Kanes are faced with the impossible task of having to destroy him once and for all. Unfortunately, the magicians of the House of Life are on the brink of civil war, the gods are divided, and the young initiates of Brooklyn House stand almost alone against the forces of chaos. The Kanes&#8217; only hope is an ancient spell that might turn the serpent&#8217;s own shadow into a weapon, but the magic has been lost for millennia. To find the answer they need, the Kanes must rely on the murderous ghost of a powerful magician who might be able to lead them to the serpent&#8217;s shadow . . . or might lead them to their deaths in the depths of the underworld. Nothing less than the mortal world is at stake when the Kane family fulfills its destiny in this thrilling conclusion to the Kane Chronicles. Exclusive to the </p>

<p>Summary : The Saga of Recluce chronicles the history of this world with world-building detail and an ingenious and disciplined magic system. L. E. Modesitt, Jr. returns to his longest and bestselling fantasy series with volume nineteen, The Mongrel Mage, which marks the beginning of a new story arc.In the world of Recluce, powerful mages can wield two kinds of magic&#8211;the white of Chaos or the black of Order. Beltur, however, has talents no one dreamed of, talents not seen in hundreds of years that blend both magics.On the run from a power hungry white mage, Beltur is taken in by Order mages who set him on the path to discover and hone his own unique gifts and in the process find a home.However, when the white mage he fled attempts to invade his new home, Beltur must hope his new found power will be enough to save them all.Saga of Recluce#1 The Magic of Recluce / #2 The Towers of the Sunset / #3 The Order War / #4 The Magic Engineer / #5 The Death of Chaos / #6 Fall of Angels / #7 The Chaos </p>

<p>Summary : In a series of personal essays, prominent journalist and LGBTQIA+ activist George M. Johnson explores his childhood, adolescence, and college years in New Jersey and Virginia. From the memories of getting his teeth kicked out by bullies at age five, to flea marketing with his loving grandmother, to his first sexual relationships, this young-adult memoir weaves together the trials and triumphs faced by Black queer boys.Both a primer for teens eager to be allies as well as a reassuring testimony for young queer men of color, All Boys Aren&#8217;t Blue covers topics such as gender identity, toxic masculinity, brotherhood, family, structural marginalization, consent, and Black joy. Johnson&#8217;s emotionally frank style of writing will appeal directly to young adults.</p>

<p>Summary : Our understanding of bacterial genetics has progressed as the genomics field has advanced. Genetics and genomics complement and influence each other; they are inseparable. Under the novel insights from genetics and genomics, once-believed borders in biology start to fade: biological knowledge of the bacterial world is being viewed under a new light and concepts are being redefined. Species are difficult to delimit and relationships within and between groups of bacteria &#8211; the whole concept of a tree of life &#8211; is hotly debated when dealing with bacteria. The DNA within bacterial cells contains a variety of features and signals that influence the diversity of the microbial world. This text assumes readers have some knowledge of genetics and microbiology but acknowledges that it can be varied. Therefore, the book includes all of the information that readers need to know in order to understand the more advanced material in the book.</p>

<p>Summary : From Gemma Hartley, the journalist who ignited a national conversation on emotional labor, comes Fed Up, a bold dive into the unpaid, invisible work women have shouldered for too long?and an impassioned vision for creating a better future for us all.Day in, day out, women anticipate and manage the needs of others. In relationships, we initiate the hard conversations. At home, we shoulder the mental load required to keep our households running. At work, we moderate our tone, explaining patiently and speaking softly. In the world, we step gingerly to keep ourselves safe. We do this largely invisible, draining work whether we want to or not?and we never clock out. No wonder women everywhere are overtaxed, exhausted, and simply fed up.In her ultra-viral article ?Women Aren?t Nags?We?re Just Fed Up,? shared by millions of readers, Gemma Hartley gave much-needed voice to the frustration and anger experienced by countless women. Now, in Fed Up, Hartley expands outward from the everyday </p>

In relationships, we initiate the hard conversations. At home, we shoulder the mental load required to keep our households running. At work, we moderate our tone, explaining patiently and speaking softly. In the world, we step gingerly to keep ourselves safe. We do this largely invisible, draining work whether we want to or not?and we never clock out.

<p>Summary : A frivolous argument or inflated claim is often dismissed with the reply, &#8220;That&#8217;s just rhetoric!&#8221; But as Scott Crider explains in The Office of Assertion, the classical tradition of rhetoric is both a productive and a liberal art. The ability to employ rhetoric successfully can enable the student, as an effective communicator, to reflect qualities of soul through argument. In that sense, rhetoric is much more than a technical skill. Crider addresses the intelligent university student with respect and humor. This short but serious book is informed by both the ancient rhetorical tradition and recent discoveries concerning the writing process. Though practical, it is not simply a &#8220;how-to&#8221; manual; though philosophical, it never loses sight of writing itself. Crider combines practical guidance about how to improve an academic essay with reflection on the final purposes?educational, political, and philosophical?of such improvement.</p>

<p>Summary : Jacky Leon is a member of the strongest werecat family alive; a family that commands the loyalty of every werecat that walks the face of the earth. Her family is the definition of power and none have dared challenge that for millennia. It?s not a legacy she?s comfortable with but it?s the one she?s been given and Jacky is resolved to do her best with her new responsibilities.

<p>Summary : Jacky Leon is a member of the strongest werecat family alive; a family that commands the loyalty of every werecat that walks the face of the earth. Her family is the definition of power and none have dared challenge that for millennia. It?s not a legacy she?s comfortable with but it?s the one she?s been given and Jacky is resolved to do her best with her new responsibilities.  When rogue werecats begin to test Jacky?s territory, paranoia mounts as questions go unanswered and lives are potentially at stake. The greatest werecat family of all time is about learn a valuable lesson, and Jacky is going to have to suffer the most before it?s through with them.  Loyalty is worthless when it?s broken.</p>

<p>Summary : A frighteningly persuasive, high-tech fable, this novel follows the lives of four narrators living in an alternative futuristic Cape Town, South Africa. Kendra, an art-school dropout, brands herself for a nanotech marketing program; Lerato, an ambitious AIDS baby, plots to defect from her corporate employers; Tendeka, a hot-headed activist, is becoming increasingly rabid; and Toby, a roguish blogger, discovers that the video games he plays for cash are much more than they seem. On a collision course that will rewire their lives, this story crackles with bold and infectious ideas, connecting a ruthless corporate-apartheid government with video games, biotech attack dogs, slippery online identities, a township soccer school, shocking cell phones, addictive branding, and genetically modified art. Taking hedonistic trends in society to their ultimate conclusions, this tale paints anything but a forecasted utopia, satirically undermining the reified idea of progress as society&#8217;s white </p>

<p>Summary : Rhodes Scholar Kerry Donovan has never had anything handed to her on a silver platter. As she arrives at Oxford to begin her course of study, she is determined to make the most out of this latest opportunity. But when she meets Her Royal Highness Princess Sasha, second in line to the British throne, Kerry&#8217;s priorities are eclipsed by an attraction neither of them can ignore.&#8221;Sassy Sasha&#8221; is a tabloid favorite who appears to delight in scandalizing her people, but beneath her vexed public image, Sasha longs to be truly seen. Will the tenuous connection she forms with Kerry be broken by the weight of the crown? Or will they find true love despite the forces endeavoring to keep them apart?</p>

<p>Summary : Nederland leerde Hendrik Groen kennen door zijn dagboek Pogingen iets van het leven te maken. Samen met zijn vriend Evert en de andere leden van de Oud-maar-niet-dood-club, probeert Hendrik zijn laatste levensjaren in een verzorgingshuis in Amsterdam-Noord zo aangenaam mogelijk te maken.Van tijd tot tijd valt het Hendrik zwaar om de moed erin te houden. Gelukkig heeft hij de pen weer opgepakt. Met de hem zo kenmerkende charmante, ironische humor neemt hij de medebewoners, de directie, zijn vrienden en de ouderdom in het algemeen op de korrel, waarbij hij zichzelf zeker niet spaart.</p>

<p>Summary : Jason Zhou survives in a divided society where the elite use their wealth to buy longer lives. The rich wear special suits that protect them from the pollution and viruses that plague the city, while those without suffer illness and early deaths. Frustrated by his city?s corruption and still grieving the loss of his mother, who died as a result of it, Zhou is determined to change things, no matter the cost.With the help of his friends, Zhou infiltrates the lives of the wealthy in hopes of destroying the international Jin Corporation from within. Jin Corp not only manufactures the special suits the rich rely on, but they may also be manufacturing the pollution that makes them necessary.Yet the deeper Zhou delves into this new world of excess and wealth, the more muddled his plans become. And against his better judgment, Zhou finds himself falling for Daiyu, the daughter of Jin Corp?s CEO. Can Zhou save his city without compromising who he is or destroying his own heart?</p>

<p>Summary : Jason Zhou survives in a divided society where the elite use their wealth to buy longer lives. The rich wear special suits that protect them from the pollution and viruses that plague the city, while those without suffer illness and early deaths. Frustrated by his city?s corruption and still grieving the loss of his mother, who died as a result of it, Zhou is determined to change things, no matter the cost.With the help of his friends, Zhou infiltrates the lives of the wealthy in hopes of destroying the international Jin Corporation from within. Jin Corp not only manufactures the special suits the rich rely on, but they may also be manufacturing the pollution that makes them necessary.Yet the deeper Zhou delves into this new world of excess and wealth, the more muddled his plans become. And against his better judgment, Zhou finds himself falling for Daiyu, the daughter of Jin Corp?s CEO. Can Zhou save his city without compromising who he is or destroying his own heart?</p>

<p>Summary : No resulta exagerado afirmar que los antiguos romanos adoraron el amor otorg?ndole la m?s alta consideraci?n. Cantaron y alabaron sus excelencias, adem?s de practicar todas sus variantes. El amor ocup? el centro de su pensamiento, a la vez que se instal? en el coraz?n de la sociedad y se manifest? en sus costumbres. Relacionado inicialmente con lo sagrado, a partir del siglo i el amor se convierte en instituci?n al multiplicarse sus ritos y representaciones. Se mezcla as? con asuntos de alta pol?tica ?basta recordar a C?sar, Cleopatra y Marco Antonio? y se encuentra incluso en la ra?z de la decadencia del imperio, ejemplificada, entre otros, por personajes como Mesalina o Ner?n. Pierre Grimal es uno de los m?s destacados latinistas y especialistas actuales en la antig?edad romana.</p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;Steve Bogira&#8217;s book takes us into the heart of America&#8217;s criminal justice system. Courtroom 302 is the story of one year in one courtroom in Chicago&#8217;s Cook County Criminal Courthouse, the busiest felony courthouse in the country.&#8221; We see the system through the eyes of the men and women who experience it, not only in the courtroom but in the lockup, the jury room, the judge&#8217;s chambers, the spectators&#8217; gallery.</p>

<p>Summary : This volume focuses on the way the entertainment industry&#8217;s owned assets were used to help push the official narrative of the &#8220;Covid 19&#8221; Scamdemic, (which has been rightly described as &#8220;The Greatest Scam Ever Perpetuated Upon Mankind.&#8221;) So many beloved musicians showed their true colours in helping to push the lies and bad science which paved the way for the tyranny and human enslavement that was always planned to be applied in its wake.This dynamic revealed beyond all doubt how the forces that have controlled the music industry for decades are intrinsically linked to those which devised the Scamdemic. There have been only a few honourable exceptions, and these names get a respectful roll call.These chapters are punctuated by a new feature &#8211; Sound Bites &#8211; an array of short stories concerning well-known music-makers which further reinforce the assertions made in previous volumes.The book ends on an inspirational note, revealing some spiritual and metaphysical truths that have been </p>

<p>Summary : This is a completely new and updated edition of J. M. Roberts and Odd Arne Westad&#8217;s widely acclaimed, landmark bestseller The Penguin History of the World.For generations of readers The Penguin History of the World has been one of the great cultural experiences &#8211; the entire story of human endeavour laid out in all its grandeur and folly, drama and pain in a single authoritative book. Now, for the first time, it has been completely overhauled for its 6th edition &#8211; not just bringing it up to date, but revising it throughout in the light of new research and discoveries, such as the revolution in our understanding of many civilizations in the Ancient World. The closing sections of the book reflect what now seems to be the inexorable rise of Asia and the increasingly troubled situation in the West.</p>

<p>Summary : This is a completely new and updated edition of J. M. Roberts and Odd Arne Westad&#8217;s widely acclaimed, landmark bestseller The Penguin History of the World.For generations of readers The Penguin History of the World has been one of the great cultural experiences &#8211; the entire story of human endeavour laid out in all its grandeur and folly, drama and pain in a single authoritative book. Now, for the first time, it has been completely overhauled for its 6th edition &#8211; not just bringing it up to date, but revising it throughout in the light of new research and discoveries, such as the revolution in our understanding of many civilizations in the Ancient World.

<p>Summary : From the author of the Waterstones Book of the Month Our Fathers comes a compelling domestic comedy about complex family dynamics, mental health and the intricacies of sibling relationships.For Alice and Hanna, saint and sinner, growing up is a trial. There is their mother, who takes a divide and conquer approach to child-rearing, and their father, who takes an absent one. There is their older brother Michael, whose disapproval is a force to be reckoned with. There is the catastrophe that is never spoken of, but which has shaped everything.As adults, Alice and Hanna must deal with disappointments in work and in love as well as increasingly complicated family tensions, and lives that look dismayingly dissimilar to what they&#8217;d intended. They must look for a way to repair their own fractured relationship, and they must finally choose their own approach to their dominant mother: submit or burn the house down. And they must decide at last whether life is really anything more than (as </p>

<p>Summary : This book is about the fundamentals of light, shadow and reflectivity; the focus is firmly on helping to improve visual understanding of the world around and on techniques for representing that world. Rendering is the next step after drawing to communicate ideas more clearly. Building on what Scott Robertson and Thomas Bertling wrote about in How To Drawing and Sketching Objects and Environments from Your Imagination, this book shares everything the two experts know about how to render light, shadow and reflective surfaces. This book is divided into two major the first explains the physics of light and shadow. One will learn how to construct proper shadows in perspective and how to apply the correct values to those surfaces. The second section focuses on the physics of reflectivity and how to render a wide range of materials utilizing this knowledge.

Now, he has to repair it before the Outsiders who destroyed it return. He also has to make Highfold safe for his family while threats rise on every side, including those that have nothing to do with Outsiders.Primordial enchantments, crafting, and battles await in the third volume of the epic series!</p>
