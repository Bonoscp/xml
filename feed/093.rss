<p>Summary : An eye-opening investigation into the science, economics, history and production of ultra-processed food.It&#8217;s not you, it&#8217;s the food.We have entered a new &#8216;age of eating&#8217; where most of our calories come from an entirely novel set of substances called Ultra-Processed Food, food which is industrially processed and designed and marketed to be addictive. But do we really know what it&#8217;s doing to our bodies?Join Chris in his travels through the world of food science and a UPF diet to discover what&#8217;s really going on. Find out why exercise and willpower can&#8217;t save us, and what UPF is really doing to our bodies, our health, our weight, and the planet (hint: nothing good).For too long we&#8217;ve been told we just need to make different choices, when really we&#8217;re living in a food environment that makes it nigh-on impossible. So this is a book about our rights. The right to know what we eat and what it does to our bodies and the right to good, affordable food.</p>

<p>Summary : A new YA novel from novelist Patrick Ness, author of the Carnegie Medal- and Kate Greenaway Medal-winning A Monster Calls and the critically acclaimed Chaos Walking trilogy, The Rest of Us Just Live Here is a bold and irreverent novel that powerfully reminds us that there are many different types of remarkable.What if you aren&#8217;t the Chosen One? The one who&#8217;s supposed to fight the zombies, or the soul-eating ghosts, or whatever the heck this new thing is, with the blue lights and the death?What if you&#8217;re like Mikey? Who just wants to graduate and go to prom and maybe finally work up the courage to ask Henna out before someone goes and blows up the high school. Again.Because sometimes there are problems bigger than this week&#8217;s end of the world, and sometimes you just have to find the extraordinary in your ordinary life.Even if your best friend is worshipped by mountain lions.</p>

<p>Summary : A new YA novel from novelist Patrick Ness, author of the Carnegie Medal- and Kate Greenaway Medal-winning A Monster Calls and the critically acclaimed Chaos Walking trilogy, The Rest of Us Just Live Here is a bold and irreverent novel that powerfully reminds us that there are many different types of remarkable.What if you aren&#8217;t the Chosen One? The one who&#8217;s supposed to fight the zombies, or the soul-eating ghosts, or whatever the heck this new thing is, with the blue lights and the death?What if you&#8217;re like Mikey? Who just wants to graduate and go to prom and maybe finally work up the courage to ask Henna out before someone goes and blows up the high school. Again.Because sometimes there are problems bigger than this week&#8217;s end of the world, and sometimes you just have to find the extraordinary in your ordinary life.Even if your best friend is worshipped by mountain lions.</p>

<p>Summary : Nic has been Selected.Chosen to leave his own body behind and become a monster.Chosen to live or die on his own wits. His own strengths.He&#8217;ll adventure out into a new realm as a footsoldier for the System&#8217;s relentless integration of new worlds. Fighting to break the natives into submission.But Nic has never loved the System, or cared for his home planet, a depleted husk of a world that the System forgot long ago. With blue skies overhead and green forest to the horizons, he might just fall in love with this strange planet named Earth&#8230;That would leave him with few friends and a thousand enemies. That would leave him clawing, biting, scratching to survive.</p>

<p>Summary : This book examines the evolution of China&#8217;s maritime security strategy, and questions what has made China shift from a constrained to a more assertive strategy.Historically, China has not been an active player in maritime security, but in recent years Beijing has begun to pursue policies and measures to safeguard its maritime rights and interests in the Indo-Pacific region. This growing influence in the region has become a concern for other countries about what kind of sea power China is developing. This book seeks to address this concern by providing an overview of the development of China&#8217;s maritime security strategy from the era of Deng Xiaoping to Xi Jinping. It suggests that while the involvement of maritime actors and the development of naval capability has provided the depth to the strategy, the national strategic guidelines from each generation of Chinese leadership has determined the overall direction of the maritime security strategy. After forty years of development, China </p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  Fate has spent centuries helping people find their mates. This Christmas, they just might find the man of their dreams. <br />
CelesteBeing the carrier of Fate&#8217;s magic gave me a lot of responsibilities. With the help of my pixies, I helped people find their mates by bringing them in each other&#8217;s paths.When one of my pixies led me to my own mate, I realized for the first time just how important my job is.Hector is everything I&#8217;d ever needed, and with the help of some small Christmas miracles, I&#8217;m determined to make him mine.HectorPeople were annoying and Christmas was nothing but a commercial gimmick. I wanted nothing to do with it, until a customer ordered my favorite tea and I found myself trapped in their pale green eyes.Celeste was beautiful, and unique, and nothing like me. They&#8217;re free, bright, and a fae with magic I couldn&#8217;t wrap my head around.Even I could admit finding my fae mate was nothing short of a Christmas miracle, if I could just manage to hold onto them.Look out </p>

<p>Summary : From the internationally acclaimed author of Blankets , a highly anticipated new graphic novel.?Sprawling across an epic landscape of deserts,?harems, and modern industrial clutter, Habibi tells the tale of Dodola and Zam, refugee child slaves bound to each other by chance, by circumstance, and by the love that grows between them. We follow them as their lives unfold together and apart; as they struggle to make a place for themselves in a world (not unlike our own) fueled by fear, lust, and greed; and as they discover the extraordinary depth?and frailty?of their connection.?At once contemporary and timeless, Habibi gives us a love story of astounding resonance: a parable about our relationship to the natural world, the cultural divide between the first and third worlds, the common heritage of Christianity and Islam, and, most potently, the magic of storytelling.</p>

<p>Summary : From TOP 15 NEW YORK TIMES and USA TODAY Bestselling and Award-Winning Author Selena Kitt &#8211; Over a Million Books Sold!David has been brightening up his gray Surrey, England days with the porn collection hidden in the shed, but when he finds that Dawn has discovered his magazines, things really begin to heat up.?Just-graduated David is looking for a job, but Dawn has the week off and is determined to work on her tan. Distracted David finds himself increasingly tempted by her, and she makes it very clear what she wants.?Her teasing ways slowly break down the taboo barrier between them until they both give in to their lust, but what are they going to do about the feelings that have developed between them in the meantime?Warnings: This title contains erotic situations, graphic language, sex, and makes mention of pornography, hammers, interesting uses for rubber bands, dungarees, bikinis, and lots of Britishisms you may or may not have to look up.</p>

<p>Summary : From award-winning author Sarah Pinsker comes a novel about one family and the technology that divides them. <br />
  Everybody&#8217;s getting one. <br />
Val and Julie just want what&#8217;s best for their kids, David and Sophie. So when teenage son David comes home one day asking for a Pilot, a new brain implant to help with school, they reluctantly agree. This is the future, after all.Soon, Julie feels mounting pressure at work to get a Pilot to keep pace with her colleagues, leaving Val and Sophie part of the shrinking minority of people without the device.Before long, the implications are clear, for the family and society: get a Pilot or get left behind. With government subsidies and no downside, why would anyone refuse? And how do you stop a technology once it&#8217;s everywhere? Those are the questions Sophie and her anti-Pilot movement rise up to answer, even if it puts them up against the Pilot&#8217;s powerful manufacturer and pits Sophie against the people she loves most.</p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;You?re so exotic!? ?You look so unusual.? ?But what are you really??Eleven-year-old Isabella is used to these kinds of comments &#8211; her father is black, her mother is white &#8211; but that doesn&#8217;t mean she likes them. And now that her parents are divorced (and getting along WORSE than ever), Isabella feels more like a push-me-pull-me toy.One week she?s Isabella with her dad, his girlfriend Anastasia, and her son Darren living in a fancy house where they are one of the only black families in the neighborhood. The next week she?s Izzy with her mom and her boyfriend John-Mark in a small, not-so-fancy house that she loves.Being split between Mom and Dad is more than switching houses, switching nicknames, switching backpacks: it?s also about switching identities. If you?re only seen as half of this and half of that, how can you ever feel whole?</p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;You?re so exotic!? ?You look so unusual.? ?But what are you really??Eleven-year-old Isabella is used to these kinds of comments &#8211; her father is black, her mother is white &#8211; but that doesn&#8217;t mean she likes them. And now that her parents are divorced (and getting along WORSE than ever), Isabella feels more like a push-me-pull-me toy.One week she?s Isabella with her dad, his girlfriend Anastasia, and her son Darren living in a fancy house where they are one of the only black families in the neighborhood. The next week she?s Izzy with her mom and her boyfriend John-Mark in a small, not-so-fancy house that she loves.Being split between Mom and Dad is more than switching houses, switching nicknames, switching backpacks: it?s also about switching identities. If you?re only seen as half of this and half of that, how can you ever feel whole?</p>

Small Homes, Grand Living&#8217;s assortment of projects and homes pays homage to the iconic innovation within modest living areas and shows the creative usage of space in continually expanding urban areas.

Compact flats perched atop the roofs on high-rise buildings. A one-bedroom apartment that houses a family of four. Stairs that cleverly transform into wardrobes. A collection of cozy cocoons shows the personality </p>

<p>Summary : There are three things you need to know about Sandra Fielding: 1) She makes all her first dates cry, 2) She hasn&#8217;t been kissed in over two years, and 3) She knows how to knit. Sandra has difficulty removing her psychotherapist hat. Of her last 30 dates, 29 have ended the same way: the man sobbing uncontrollably. After one such disaster, Sandra&#8211;near desperation and maybe a little tipsy&#8211;gives in to a seemingly harmless encounter with her hot waiter, Alex. Argumentative, secretive, and hostile Alex may be the opposite of everything Sandra knows is right for her. But now, the girl who has spent all her life helping others change for the better, must find a way to cope with falling for someone who refuses to change at all.</p>

<p>Summary : Told from the point of view of an ancient shaman, this is the dark and mystical story of Mexico&#8217;s greatest revolutionary general, Pancho Villa. Shedding the Hollywood mantle of the drunken, womanizing bandit-turned-hero, the Villa who comes to life in this extraordinary novel is part man and part myth, part visionary hoodlum and part brilliant general. A troubled childhood&#8211;marked by his father&#8217;s early death in the fields and his sister&#8217;s rape by a local landowner&#8211;and a prophetic dream propel young Villa through a period of lawlessness and drifting and into life as a military leader. The story moves convincingly through the events of Villa&#8217;s life, showing him to be a man of fierce passions and moral conviction, a natural leader for the rebellion.</p>

<p>Summary : We join San in 1970s rural South Korea, a young girl ostracised from her community. She meets a girl called Namae, and they become friends until one afternoon changes everything. Following a moment of physical intimacy in a minari field, Namae violently rejects San, setting her on a troubling path of quashed desire and isolation. We next meet San, aged twenty-two, as she starts a job in a flower shop. There, we are introduced to a colourful cast of characters, including the shop&#8217;s mute owner, the other florist Su-ae, and the customers that include a sexually aggressive businessman and a photographer, who San develops an obsession for. Throughout, San&#8217;s moment with Namae lingers in the back of her mind.A story of desire and violence about a young woman who everyone forgot, VIOLETS is a captivating and sensual read, full of tragedy and beauty.</p>

<p>Summary : Explore the foundations of Buddhism the path out of suffering and the true nature of self, life, and reality with thisplain-English primer. Three great teachings of the Buddha laid down the bedrock of Buddhist thought and practice. Known as the three turnings of the wheel, they introduced to the world concepts such as the four noble truths and emptiness that would revolutionize religious and philosophical thinking.  In remarkably clear language, James Coleman guides the reader through the ancient sutras that preserve the Buddha s message, teasing out their meaning for the modern reader. We begin with the Pali Canon, the earliest record of the Buddha s teachings, and then move through the earthshatteringPerfection of Wisdomliterature of the second turning. Finally, Coleman s clear and simple presentation of the monumental Samdhinirmocana Sutra, or Sutra of the Explanation of the Profound Secrets, ties the Buddha s wisdom together for us. The book concludes with chapters from two great </p>

<p>Summary : Award-winning historian Mary Beth Norton reexamines the Salem witch trials in this startlingly original, meticulously researched, and utterly riveting study.In 1692 the people of Massachusetts were living in fear, and not solely of satanic afflictions. Horrifyingly violent Indian attacks had all but emptied the northern frontier of settlers, and many traumatized refugees?including the main accusers of witches?had fled to communities like Salem. Meanwhile the colony?s leaders, defensive about their own failure to protect the frontier, pondered how God?s people could be suffering at the hands of savages. Struck by the similarities between what the refugees had witnessed and what the witchcraft ?victims? described, many were quick to see a vast conspiracy of the Devil (in league with the French and the Indians) threatening New England on all sides. By providing this essential context to the famous events, and by casting her net well beyond the borders of Salem itself, Norton sheds new </p>

<p>Summary : United Nations, Red Scorpions, the Crazy Dragons, Fresh Off the Boat, Indian Posse, Native Syndicate, Mad Cowz, Bloods, Jamestown Crips, Bo-Gars, Crack Down Posse, African Mafia, Galloway Boys, Malvern Crew, Manitoba Warriors, and North Preston&#8217;s Finest.

<p>Summary : United Nations, Red Scorpions, the Crazy Dragons, Fresh Off the Boat, Indian Posse, Native Syndicate, Mad Cowz, Bloods, Jamestown Crips, Bo-Gars, Crack Down Posse, African Mafia, Galloway Boys, Malvern Crew, Manitoba Warriors, and North Preston&#8217;s Finest. These are some of the gangs active in Canada today. Dr. Mark Totten has spent fifteen years learning all about these gangs and the young men and women who belong to them. He has interviewed over 500 gang members across the country, traced their lives from infancy to adulthood, and explored the roots of their involvement in crime and their reliance on violence.This book offers a groundbreaking picture of the reality of gangs in Canada. Much of what Dr. Totten has to say is at odds with popular ideas. His research leads him to believe that breaking through the circumstances that produce young criminals is far more difficult than most people think.

<p>Summary : Anaesthetising a fish, x-raying a frog and hospitalising a walrus are all in a day&#8217;s work for the world&#8217;s wildest veterinarian.Travelling from the rainforests of Sierra Leone to the jungles of Borneo, Romain Pizzi has caught, anaesthetised, diagnosed, operated on, medicated, and then released some of the world&#8217;s most endangered wild animals.From disease testing Polynesian snails to keyhole surgery in Sumatran orangutans; from endoscopy in sharks to ultrasound on a chimpanzee. Sometimes this is high tech work, such as the first robotic surgery in a tiger, or giant panda cloning attempts. Sometimes the situations are more primitive, from anaesthetising a bear with a bicycle pump, old plumbing tubes and a plank, to operating on a vulture using an old metal spoon.In Exotic Vetting, Romain recalls his many interesting patients, while taking readers on a tour of the challenges of treating the world&#8217;s amazing spectrum of wild animal species.</p>

<p>Summary : A haunting illustrated novel from the author of the highly acclaimed Thornhill.Told in two alternating narratives, The Hideaway tells the story of Billy McKenna, who runs away from home and takes refuge in an overgrown graveyard. The first narrative is told from his perspective, whereas the second thread tells of the situation at home and the police search for Billy. Covering themes of domestic violence, families, childhood, being separated and reunited, this is an important and beautifully illustrated book for middle grade readers right up to adults.The Hideaway is illustrated throughout with tonal and textured black and white drawings. The atmospheric illustrations seep into the edge of the pages before they give way to a series of double-page spreads as the story reaches its climax.</p>

<p>Summary : En C?mo a manejar a tus esclavos, un adinerado romano propietario de diversos esclavos, Marco Sidonio Falco (con la ir?nica colaboraci?n del especialista en estudios cl?sicos de la Universidad de Cambridge, Jerry Toner), nos ofrece respuestas pr?cticas a todas las preguntas que podr?amos formularnos sobre un aspecto fundamental de la vida en Roma y su imperio:? D?nde y c?mo comprar esclavos.? C?mo sacar el m?ximo partido de ellos.? En qu? circunstancias concederles la libertad. La esclavitud fue una instituci?n clave en el mundo romano durante la totalidad de su larga existencia, y el punto de vista de un romano nos permitir? comprender por qu? los esclavos fueron tan importantes para ellos. Un obra indispensable en la historiograf?a sobre Roma, que c?mo afirma Mary Beard, nos invita a reflexionar tambi?n acerca de si los antiguos romanos eran, realmente, tan diferentes de nosotros.</p>

<p>Summary : Whale, set in a remote village in South Korea, follows the lives of three linked characters: Geumbok, an extremely ambitious woman who has been chasing an indescribable thrill ever since she first saw a whale crest in the ocean; her mute daughter, Chunhui, who communicates with elephants; and a one-eyed woman who controls honeybees with a whistle. Brimming with surprises and wicked humor, Whale is an adventure-satire of epic proportions by one of the most original voices in South Korea.</p>

<p>Summary : A new rival enters the scene in the form of Shikki, one of the girls on Nagatoro?s Judo team. Shikki proves to be a formidable opponent on the mat, but she also becomes a handful of trouble (and other things) for Nagatoro and Senpai when she discovers them both in the wrong place at the wrong time. Now, Senpai stands to be on the receiving end of a visual assault like no other, but does Nagatoro have what it takes to save him (and his virtue)?</p>

<p>Summary : Galaxy &#8220;Alex&#8221; Stern ? la matricola pi? atipica di tutta Yale. Cresciuta nei sobborghi di Los Angeles insieme alla madre hippie, viene espulsa molto presto dal mondo della scuola e, giovanissima, entra in una realt? fatta di fidanzati spacciatori, lavori senza prospettive e molto molto peggio. A vent&#8217;anni, ? l&#8217;unica superstite di un orrendo, irrisolto omicidio multiplo. Ma ? a questo punto che accade l&#8217;impensabile. Ancora costretta in un letto d&#8217;ospedale, le viene offerta una seconda possibilit?: una borsa di studio a copertura totale per frequentare una delle pi? prestigiose universit? del mondo. Qual ? l&#8217;inganno e perch? proprio lei? Mentre prosegue nella sua ricerca di risposte, Alex arriva a New Haven con un compito ben preciso affidatole dai suoi misteriosi benefattori: monitorare le attivit? occulte delle confraternite che gravitano intorno a Yale.</p>

<p>Summary : Many people who have ever owned a pet will swear that their dog or cat or other animal has exhibited some kind of behavior they just can&#8217;t explain.

<p>Summary : In queste pagine si racconta la vicenda di Isabella d&#8217;Este, divenuta marchesa di Mantova dopo il matrimonio con Francesco Gonzaga; non di una semplice per quanto raffinata biografia si tratta, per?, quanto di un vero e proprio romanzo: sia per la presenza di alcuni personaggi totalmente inventati &#8211; come Robert de la Pole, corrispondente del re d&#8217;inghilterra e innamorato platonico di Isabella -, sia soprattutto per la qualit? della scrittura, che sembra avvolgere in una sorta di abbagliante pulviscolo ogni figura e ogni fatto storico. Protagonista assoluta ? lei, Isabella, che ormai alla soglia dei sessant&#8217;anni rievoca la propria vita da quando, sposa sedicenne, giunse a Mantova e in un periodo tra i pi? tumultuosi e fulgidi della nostra storia, a cavallo tra Quattro e Cinquecento, resse le fila del piccolo stato costruendo attorno a s? una corte di ineguagliato splendore.</p>

Protagonista assoluta ? lei, Isabella, che ormai alla soglia dei sessant&amp;#8217;anni rievoca la propria vita da quando, sposa sedicenne, giunse a Mantova e in un periodo tra i pi? tumultuosi e fulgidi della nostra storia, a cavallo tra Quattro e Cinquecento, resse le fila del piccolo stato costruendo attorno a s? una corte di ineguagliato splendore.

With entire Warrior units getting mysteriously wiped out, she must help devise a critical antidote.

As the strongest of her kind, she may be their only hope of saving an entire species on the verge of annihilation!With time ticking and so many lives in the balance, will Liena overcome her trauma, or </p>

<p>Summary : Chaos. Carnage. Killing.The three Cs that make my life complete.I know killing technically doesn?t start with a C ? but wouldn?t life be better if it did? Just like it would be better if the Devil was my boyfriend, Santa wasn?t a d*ck and I didn?t live under a bridge.I wished for my life to improve, but it didn?t. I was kidnapped, sold, sold again, stuck in a death game, sold AGAIN and now I?m living in a serial killer?s basement.Oh and there?s another dude down here who lives in a cage and doesn?t talk. I call him Dead Man on account of his soulless eyes. He either wants to kiss me or choke me out. I can?t decide which I want most.Anyways, my hot, tattooed, muscular insane Irish captor thinks I might make a good hit woman once he trains me up. Which is a freaking insult by the way as I?m already the best killer in town. Ask anyone. Except the cops. Don?t ask them or they?ll send me back to that creepy asylum where they gave me the crazy pills. But shh, that?s a secret. Want to know </p>

<p>Summary : From the #1 New York Times best-selling author of The Darkest Minds comes a sweepingly ambitious, high-octane tale of power, destiny, love and redemption.Every seven years, the Agon begins. As punishment for a past rebellion, nine Greek gods are forced to walk the earth as mortals, hunted by the descendants of ancient bloodlines, all eager to kill a god and seize their divine power and immortality.Long ago, Lore Perseous fled that brutal world in the wake of her family&#8217;s sadistic murder by a rival line, turning her back on the hunt&#8217;s promises of eternal glory. For years she&#8217;s pushed away any thought of revenge against the man&#8211;now a god&#8211;responsible for their deaths.Yet as the next hunt dawns over New York City, two participants seek out her help: Castor, a childhood friend of Lore believed long dead, and a gravely wounded Athena, among the last of the original gods.The goddess offers an alliance against their mutual enemy and, at last, a way for Lore to leave the Agon behind </p>

As punishment for a past rebellion, nine Greek gods are forced to walk the earth as mortals, hunted by the descendants of ancient bloodlines, all eager to kill a god and seize their divine power and immortality.Long ago, Lore Perseous fled that brutal world in the wake of her family&#8217;s sadistic murder by a rival line, turning her back on the hunt&#8217;s promises of eternal glory. For years she&#8217;s pushed away any thought of revenge against the man&#8211;now a god&#8211;responsible for their deaths.Yet as the next hunt dawns over New York City, two participants seek out her help: Castor, a childhood friend of Lore believed long dead, and a gravely wounded Athena, among the last of the original gods.The goddess offers an alliance against their mutual enemy and, at last, a way for Lore to leave the Agon behind </p>

<p>Summary : Streghe che cavalcano lupi e iene, cortei notturni di morti senza riposo, uomini trasformati in animali, formule magiche in grado di controllare spiriti e divinit?: ogni popolo e ogni cultura del mondo, dall?alba dei tempi fino a oggi, ha creduto nell?esistenza di individui capaci di nuocere agli altri attraverso poteri magici; personaggi che incutono paura o provocano repulsione, dai quali ? necessario difendersi, le cui caratteristiche vanno a formare la sfaccettata figura della strega.Dall?Africa al Baltico, dall?antica Grecia alle Americhe, le streghe hanno tratti sorprendentemente simili: agiscono di notte, causano malattie e morte a distanza, sono particolarmente pericolose per i bambini, costituiscono una minaccia per l?ordine sociale. Il mondo antico teme e disprezza chi pratica la stregoneria perch? considera i suoi poteri un tentativo di appropriarsi di prerogative divine, e nella Roma imperiale la magia ? combattuta ferocemente in nome della religione ufficiale.

<p>Summary : Pubblicato per la prima volta nel 1976, Il formaggio e i vermi ritorna arricchito da una postfazione. Nel frattempo, tradotta in ventisei lingue, la vicenda del mugnaio friulano Domenico Scandella detto Menocchio, messo a morte dall&#8217;Inquisizione alla fine del &#8216;500, ha fatto il giro del mondo, mostrando come sia possibile, attraverso gli archivi inquisitoriali, cogliere le voci di individui che spesso non compaiono, o compaiono solo in maniera indiretta, nella documentazione storica: dai contadini alle donne. Il mugnaio Menocchio era senza dubbio una figura straordinaria, percepita come anomala anche dai suoi compaesani; l&#8217;ampiezza delle sue letture, la ricchezza delle sue reazioni ai libri, l&#8217;audacia delle sue idee non finiscono di stupire. Ma anche un caso eccezionale (qui sta la scommessa del libro) pu? gettar luce su problemi di vaste dimensioni: dalla sfida alle autorit? in una societ? preindustriale all&#8217;intreccio fra cultura orale e cultura scritta.Come chiarisce la nuova </p>

<p>Summary : As robots are increasingly integrated into modern society?on the battlefield and the road, in business, education, and health?Pulitzer-Prize-winning New York Times science writer John Markoff searches for an answer to one of the most important questions of our age: will these machines help us, or will they replace us?In the past decade alone, Google introduced us to driverless cars, Apple debuted a personal assistant that we keep in our pockets, and an Internet of Things connected the smaller tasks of everyday life to the farthest reaches of the internet. There is little doubt that robots are now an integral part of society, and cheap sensors and powerful computers will ensure that, in the coming years, these robots will soon act on their own. This new era offers the promise of immense computing power, but it also reframes a question first raised more than half a century ago, at the birth of the intelligent machine: Will we control these systems, or will they control us?In Machines </p>

<p>Summary : Being literate in an academic discipline means more than simply being able to read and comprehend text; it means you can think, speak, and write as a historian, scientist, mathematician, or artist. Doug Buehl strips away the one-size-fits-all approach to content area literacy and presents a much-needed instructional model for disciplinary literacy, showing how to mentor middle and high school learners to become ?academic insiders? who are college and career ready. This thoroughly revised second edition of Developing Readers in the Academic Disciplines shows how to help students adjust their thinking to comprehend a range of complex texts that fall outside their reading comfort zones.

<p>Summary : Se supon?a que iban a ser unas vacaciones relajantes y soleadas en compa??a de mi hermano, pero descubrir un cad?ver en nuestra casa de alquiler ha acabado con nuestros planes de broncearnos. Ahora un cazarrecompensas impertinente ha llegado en su moto para atrapar al asesino, pero se niega a creer que yo pueda ser ?til, a pesar de las innumerables horas de p?dcast sobre cr?menes que he escuchado? Por no mencionar mi exitosa carrera como profesora de ni?os revoltosos. Un cazarrecompensas descarado y una maestra en?rgica: sin duda, el equipo de resoluci?n de cr?menes que nadie ha pedido. Pero, gracias a estos inoportunos atentados contra mi vida, hemos acabado atrapados juntos contra viento y marea. Estoy aqu? para hacer mi trabajo, no para hacer de ni?ero de una detective aficionada. Aunque cada vez me cuesta menos tenerla cerca. De acuerdo, es obstinada, molesta y es incapaz de mantenerse alejada del peligro. Pero tambi?n es valiente y atractiva y me recuerda al hogar que dej? hace </p>

<p>Summary : Conflict at sea has been transformed by disruptive technologies, creating a dynamic and distributed operational environment that extends from the oceans to encompass warfare on land, in the air, outer space, and cyberspace. This raises choice of law decisions that include the law of navalwarfare and the law of armed conflict, neutrality law, and the peacetime regimes that apply to the oceans, airspace, outer space, and cyberspace. The international law in networked naval warfare must contend with autonomous vessels and aircraft, artificial intelligence, and long-range precisionstrike missiles that can close the kill chain at sea and beyond.

<p>Summary : Conflict at sea has been transformed by disruptive technologies, creating a dynamic and distributed operational environment that extends from the oceans to encompass warfare on land, in the air, outer space, and cyberspace.

<p>Summary : A tense, page-turning psychological drama about the making and breaking of a family&#8211;and a woman whose experience of motherhood is nothing at all what she hoped for&#8211;and everything she feared.Blythe Connor is determined that she will be the warm, comforting mother to her new baby Violet that she herself never had. But in the thick of motherhood&#8217;s exhausting early days, Blythe becomes convinced that something is wrong with her daughter&#8211;she doesn&#8217;t behave like most children do.Or is it all in Blythe&#8217;s head? Her husband, Fox, says she&#8217;s imagining things.

Even Violet seems to love her little brother. But when life as they know it is changed in an instant, the devastating fall-out forces Blythe to face the </p>

<p>Summary : Alaa Abd el-Fattah, 39, is arguably the most high profile political prisoner in Egypt, if not the Arab world. A leading figure among the young technologists and bloggers of the 2000s he rose to international prominence during the revolution of 2011. A fiercely independent thinker who fuses politics and technology in powerful prose, an activist whose ideas represent a global generation which has only known struggle against a failing system, a public intellectual with the rare courage to offer personal, painful honesty, Alaa&#8217;s written voice came to symbolize much of what was fresh, inspiring and revolutionary about the uprisings that have defined the last decade. Alaa has been in prison for most of the last seven years and many of the pieces collected here were smuggled out of his cell. From theses on technology, to theories of history, to painful reflections on the meaning of prison, his voice in these pages &#8211; arranged by family and friends &#8211; cuts as sharply relevant, as dangerous, as </p>

A fiercely independent thinker who fuses politics and technology in powerful prose, an activist whose ideas represent a global generation which has only known struggle against a failing system, a public intellectual with the rare courage to offer personal, painful honesty, Alaa&amp;#8217;s written voice came to symbolize much of what was fresh, inspiring and revolutionary about the uprisings that have defined the last decade. Alaa has been in prison for most of the last seven years and many of the pieces collected here were smuggled out of his cell. From theses on technology, to theories of history, to painful reflections on the meaning of prison, his voice in these pages &amp;#8211; arranged by family and friends &amp;#8211; cuts as sharply relevant, as dangerous, as Discover the Bestseller Everyone is Talking About: Read You Have Not Yet Been Defeated: Selected Writings 2011-2021 PDF , Reading You Have Not Yet Been Defeated: Selected Writings 2011-2021 pdf , You Have Not Yet Been Defeated: Selected Writings 2011-2021 Handbook , You Have Not Yet Been Defeated: Selected Writings 2011-2021 read , You Have Not Yet Been Defeated: Selected Writings 2011-2021 epub , You Have Not Yet Been Defeated: Selected Writings 2011-2021 in English , You Have Not Yet Been Defeated: Selected Writings 2011-2021 Kindle , You Have Not Yet Been Defeated: Selected Writings 2011-2021 audiobook You Have Not Yet Been Defeated: Selected Writings 2011-2021 Summary.

<p>Summary : August Wilson has already given the American theater such spell-binding plays about the black experience in 20th-century America as Ma Rainey&#8217;s Black Bottom, Joe Turner&#8217;s Come and Gone, and the Pulitzer Prize-winning, Fences. In his second Pulitzer Prize-winner, The Piano Lesson, Wilson has fashioned his most haunting and dramatic work yet. At the heart of his play stands the ornately carved upright piano which, as the Charles family&#8217;s prized, hard-won possession, has been gathering dust in the parlor of Berniece Charles&#8217;s Pittsburgh home. When Boy Willie, Berniece&#8217;s exuberant brother, bursts into her life with his dream of buying the same Mississippi land that his family had worked as slaves, he plans to sell their antique piano for the hard cash he needs to stake his future. But Berniece refuses to sell, clinging to the piano as a reminder of the history that is their family legacy. This dilemma is the real &#8220;piano lesson,&#8221; reminding us that blacks are often deprived both of the </p>

If they are ever going to set foot back on terra firma, they&#8221;ll first have to battle man-eating sentient plants, ally themselves with bat-winged men to fend off poisonous monsters, and be clever enough to escape the space zoo of the curious Kliklag!</p>

<p>Summary : Mending Life is a beautifully illustrated, practical tool kit for repairing the clothes and belongings we love. It is also an exploration of how mending can be a gently healing practice in our daily lives and a small act of rebellion in a world where many things are discarded without thought.Mending Life encourages us to cherish our things by repairing them rather than discarding them. It also encourages us to change our consumption habits so that with small mends here and there, we extend the life of our garments and other household items. This handbook is for beginners but also offers more advanced techniques to those with some experience in mending.You&#8217;ll learn basic techniques such as patching, but will have options to take it a step further with decorative sashiko stitching; you&#8217;ll also learn how to darn socks and mend sweaters, as well as things like a tear in a bedsheet or down jacket. And along the way, the authors share heartfelt stories about the powerful act of mending, </p>

<p>Summary : Now in its fourth edition, Finance for the Nonfinancial Manager has emerged as an indispensable reference for managers, business owners, and executives. First published almost two decades ago, it has been completely updated to reflect the latest tax laws, the growing importance of an international perspective in economic analyses, and the increased use of computers for data storage and analyses. Filled with new charts, tables, and relevant examples, this complete guide spans the financial spectrum, from flexible budgets to zero based budgeting, cash flow to cash management, flat tax to tax shelters. It also offers keys to important skills such as calculating interest, deciphering financial statements, designing budgets, and applying break-even analysis. Each chapter concludes with a summary highlighting the major points covered, and a glossary of important terms is included for quick reference.</p>

<p>Summary : Trans people in Britain today have become a culture war &#8216;issue&#8217;. Despite making up less than 1% of the country&#8217;s population, they are the subjects of a toxic and increasingly polarised &#8216;debate&#8217;, which generates reliable controversy for newspapers and talk shows. This media frenzy conceals a simple fact: that we are having the wrong conversation, a conversation in which trans people themselves are reduced to a talking point and denied a meaningful voice.In this powerful new book, Shon Faye reclaims the idea of the &#8216;transgender issue&#8217; to uncover the reality of what it means to be trans in a transphobic society. In doing so, she provides a compelling, wide-ranging analysis of trans lives from youth to old age, exploring work, family, housing, healthcare, the prison system, and trans participation in the LGBTQ+ and feminist communities, in contemporary Britain and beyond.The Transgender Issue is a landmark work that signals the beginning of a new, healthier conversation about trans life. </p>

And we would become the mirrors that reflected each other&#8217;s most private wounds&#8230;and desires.The bonds of his love transformed me, even as I prayed that the torment of our pasts didn&#8217;t tear us apart&#8230;. <br />

I couldn&#8217;t stay away. I didn&#8217;t want to. He was my addiction&#8230;my every desire&#8230;mine.My past was as violent as his, and I was just as broken. We&#8217;d never work.

<p>Summary : Disabled people have emerged from the shadows and back rooms of our institutions, upping the ante on demands for an inclusive society. Claiming Disability captures this moment in the first comprehensive examination of disability studies as a field of inquiry. Arguing that disability studies takes for its subject matter not simply the variations that exist in human behavior, appearance, functioning, sensory acuity, and cognitive processing, but the meaning we make of those variations, this work offers both a passionate challenge to status quo definitions of disability and a methodology for reexamining it.</p>

<p>Summary : Less than six months ago my life was twisted and flipped on its side. Things have changed so much I barely recognize myself anymore. I am no longer an Enforcer. I am no longer a Witch. I no longer hate the Fae. (For the most part) And the sex-on-a-stick-gorgeous-Fae? He isn&#8217;t really the Dark Prince. No, he is the father of my children and with the babies on the way, the land dying and the Mages closing in; alliances will have to be formed if we are all to make it through the war that is coming to our front door. Between warring Gods and Goddesses, how are any of us supposed to win?</p>

<p>Summary : This exciting and comprehensive anthology?the first anthology of German women&#8217;s fairy tales in English?presents a variety of published and archival fairy tales from 1780 to 1900. These authors of these stories used fairy tales to explain their own lives, to teach children, to examine history, and to critique society and the status quo. Powerful and conflicted females are queens, girls on quests, mothers, daughters, magical wisewomen, and midwives to the fairies; they love, hate, murder, save children, fight tyranny, overcome cannibals, and rescue the working poor.Jeannine Blackwell&#8217;s introduction places the tales in their historical, social, and critical context, and Shawn C. Jarvis&#8217;s afterword presents a thematic analysis of the texts and approaches to reading them in conjunction with other European and American tales.</p>

<p>Summary : How does it feel when your heritage isn&#8217;t listed as an option on an identification form?What is it like to grow up as the only person in your family who looks like you?Where do you belong if you are simultaneously seen as being &#8216;too much&#8217; of one race and &#8216;not enough&#8217; of another to fit neatly into society&#8217;s expectations?The mixed population is the fastest-growing group in the U.K. today, but the mainstream conversation around mixedness is stilted, repetitive and often problematic.

<p>Summary : They say I must be put to death for what happened to Madame, and they want me to confess. But how can I confess what I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve done?1826, and all of London is in a frenzy. Crowds gather at the gates of the Old Bailey to watch as Frannie Langton, maid to Mr and Mrs Benham, goes on trial for their murder. The testimonies against her are damning &#8211; slave, whore, seductress. And they may be the truth. But they are not the whole truth.For the first time Frannie must tell her story. It begins with a girl learning to read on a plantation in Jamaica, and it ends in a grand house in London, where a beautiful woman waits to be freed.But through her fevered confessions, one burning question haunts Frannie Langton: could she have murdered the only person she ever loved?</p>

<p>Summary : A saga of survival, technological innovation, and breathtaking human physical achievement &#8212; all set against the backdrop of a world headed toward war &#8212; that became one of the most compelling international dramas of the 20th century.As tension steadily rose between European powers in the 1930s, a different kind of battle was already raging across the Himalayas. Teams of mountaineers from Great Britain, Nazi Germany, and the United States were all competing to be the first to climb the world&#8217;s highest peaks, including Mount Everest and K2. Unlike climbers today, they had few photographs or maps, no properly working oxygen systems, and they wore leather boots and cotton parkas. Amazingly, and against all odds, they soon went farther and higher than anyone could have imagined. And as they did, their story caught the world&#8217;s attention. The climbers were mobbed at train stations, and were featured in movies and plays. James Hilton created the mythical land of Shangri-La in Lost Horizon, </p>

The climbers were mobbed at train stations, and were featured in movies and plays. James Hilton created the mythical land of Shangri-La in Lost Horizon, </p>

<p>Summary : Zhao Yunlan is Chief of the Special Investigations Department: a secret group of uniquely skilled individuals who investigate strange happenings in modern-day Dragon City. Although laid-back and cheeky to those who don&#8217;t know him, this tenacious and cunning man fits well into his role of the Guardian.While investigating a mysterious death at a local university, Zhao Yunlan meets Shen Wei, a calm and cold professor who proves as intriguing as the case itself. Something about this reserved man feels strangely familiar. Zhao Yunlan can&#8217;t help but notice the intensity of the professor&#8217;s gaze, and wonders why their lives begin to intertwine?as if by fate.</p>

<p>Summary : An endearing portrait of an Indian legendI told him that when I write a book, I would write about another side of him and not just historic events or business milestones. I would write about us and our adventures together, and how I saw him, colours and shades of him unknown to the world. Life beyond the great steel wall of &#8216;industry doyen&#8217;.He agreed. &#8216;There cannot be one book that captures everything &#8230; So you do your thing, give your perspective.&#8217;It was their shared empathy for homeless dogs that sparked an unlikely friendship. In 2014, Shantanu Naidu, an automobile design engineer in his early twenties, developed an innovation to save the local strays from being run over by speeding cars. Ratan Tata, himself known for his compassion for stray dogs, took note. Impressed, he not only decided to invest in the venture, but over the years became a mentor, boss and an unexpectedly dear friend to Shantanu.I Came Upon a Lighthouse is an honest, light-hearted telling of this uncommon bond </p>

<p>Summary : Today, F. Scott Fitzgerald is known for his novels, but in his lifetime, his fame stemmed from his prolific achievement as one of America&#8217;s most gifted story writers. &#8220;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,&#8221; a witty and fantastical satire about aging, is one of his most memorable stories.  In 1860 Benjamin Button is born an old man and mysteriously begins aging backward. At the beginning of his life he is withered and worn, but as he continues to grow younger he embraces life &#8212; he goes to war, runs a business, falls in love, has children, goes to college and prep school, and, as his mind begins to devolve, he attends kindergarten and eventually returns to the care of his nurse.  This strange and haunting story embodies the sharp social insight that has made Fitzgerald one of the great voices in the history of American literature.</p>

<p>Summary : I thought I was the one straight Theriot cousin&#8230;But I was wrong.Because when Sheriff Eric Winston demanded my help in ridding his territory of pure evil, I couldn?t say no.The man?s infuriating?a clean-cut do-gooder?and my family?s never exactly been friends with the law. But I couldn?t deny I owed the man a favor?And I can?t deny the things he makes me feel either.I want to protect him. To kiss him. To possess him.To save him from the enemy that threatens to take him away from me.To break down every obstacle that could keep us apart?Even the ones in my own mind. Because I thought I was the one Theriot cousin who could never fall in love?But I might have been wrong about that, too.</p>

<p>Summary : Lucidly written by leading biblical scholars Michael D. Coogan and Cynthia R. Chapman, this balanced, engaging, and up-to-date introduction to the Hebrew scriptures distills the best of current scholarship.

<p>Summary : Here, for the first time, is the private and most intimate correspondence of one of America&#8217;s most influential and incisive journalists?Hunter S. Thompson. In letters to a Who&#8217;s Who of luminaries from Norman Mailer to Charles Kuralt, Tom Wolfe to Lyndon Johnson, William Styron to Joan Baez?not to mention his mother, the NRA, and a chain of newspaper editors?Thompson vividly catches the tenor of the times in 1960s America and channels it all through his own razor-sharp perspective. Passionate in their admiration, merciless in their scorn, and never anything less than fascinating, the dispatches of The Proud Highway offer an unprecedented and penetrating gaze into the evolution of the most outrageous raconteur/provocateur ever to assault a typewriter.</p>

<p>Summary : What&#8217;s the first rule of running a gym for combat vets?Enjoy the scorching hot scenery, but get your kicks somewhere else.Never mind that my cousin-slash-business partner ignores that rule every chance he gets. I don&#8217;t ignore it. Ever. And frankly, between Grindr and living in one of the gayest cities in America, it&#8217;s not exactly a hardship.Hell, it&#8217;s so easy, I can do it on one leg.That is, until a pair of blue eyes swimming with vulnerability shows up at my door, looking for a job. He&#8217;s too skinny, too mouthy, and way too young for the likes of me, but he pings that protector instinct in me, hard.I want to fix whatever put that lost look in his eyes, but to manage that, I&#8217;d have to do the one thing I said I&#8217;d never do.Break my own rules.Sanctuary is an MM military romance featuring hurt-comfort, found family, and a gym full of ripped men wearing tight shorts lifting heavy objects.</p>

<p>Summary : The Language Teacher Toolkit is designed with both practising and trainee (pre-service) teachers in mind and uniquely bridges the gap between research and classroom practice. It is a comprehensive and clearly written handbook, particularly useful for teachers of modern foreign languages (world languages) who work in high schools (secondary education). Written by two highly-experienced teachers with an interest in research and theory, it offers a reflective approach along with many practical classroom activities which can immediately be applied in daily teaching. The book closes with sample lessons for French, German and Spanish. Chapters include: &#8211; methods &#8211; classroom oral techniques &#8211; teaching in the target language &#8211; developing spontaneous talk &#8211; teaching grammar and vocabulary &#8211; listening, reading and writing &#8211; subject knowledge &#8211; using song, drama and games &#8211; assessment &#8211; using pictures &#8211; teaching advanced level students &#8211; technology &#8211; behaviour and motivation &#8211; evaluating and </p>

<p>Summary : Born on the fringes of Bethel, Immanuelle does her best to obey the Church and follow Holy Protocol. For it was in Bethel that the first Prophet pursued and killed four powerful witches and so cleansed the land.And then a chance encounter lures her into the Darkwood that surrounds Bethel.It is a forbidden place, haunted by the spirits of the witches who bestow an extraordinary gift on Immanuelle. The diary of her dead mother&#8230;.Fascinated by and fearful of the secrets the diary reveals, Immanuelle begins to understand why her mother once consorted with witches. And as the truth about the Prophets, the Church and their history is revealed, so Immanuelle understands what must be done. For the real threat to Bethel is its own darkness.Bethel must change. And that change will begin with her&#8230;.</p>

<p>Summary : In this gripping, funny addition to the bestselling Lemonade War series, both Jessie and her brother Evan find themselves unexpectedly cast as outsiders. How they find their way forward makes for a timeless story about the power of courage and kindness.Evan and Jessie Treski have waged a lemonade war, sought justice in a class trial, unmasked a bell thief, and created a professional magic show. Yet for all their skills and talents, both find them themselves being singled out this summer for reasons beyond their control.Natural-born leader Evan, who is always good at making new friends, discovers he is at the mercy of a bully on the summer school playground, and is pressured to act in a way he never has before.Science-loving Jessie just wants to construct the best bridge she can for the competition next month, yet she is stuck in the wrong summer camp, surrounded by kids who believe fairies are more real than physics and a group of girls who tortured her back in second grade. </p>

<p>Summary : A propulsive debut with a wicked sense of humor in which two American ex-pats obsessed with the Amanda Knox trial find themselves at the nexus of murder and celebrity in glittering late-aughts Berlin.Hoping to escape the pain of the recent murder of her best friend, art student Zoe Beech finds herself studying abroad in the bohemian capital of Europe&#8211;Berlin. Zoe, rudderless, relies on the arrangements of fellow exchange student Hailey Mader, who idolizes Warhol and Britney Spears and wants nothing more than to be an art star. On Craigslist, Hailey unknowingly stumbles on an apartment sublet posted by a well-known thriller writer. Feeling as though they&#8217;ve won the lottery, the women move into the high-ceilinged pre-war flat. Soon they realize that their landlady, Beatrice, who is supposed to be on a residency in Vienna, is watching them&#8211;and her next book appears to be based on their lives. Taking stock of their mundane routines&#8211;Law and Order binges and nightly nachos&#8211;Hailey </p>

<p>Summary : This dramatic adaptation of Homer&#8217;s myth begins with a modern young woman who is struggling to understand Robert Fitzgerald&#8217;s translation of The Odyssey. A classical muse appears, and the young woman becomes the goddess Athena&#8211;a tireless advocate for Odysseus in his struggle to get home. With her trademark irreverent and witty twist on classic works, Zimmerman brings to life the story of Odysseus&#8217;s ten-year journey, depicting his encounters with characters such as Circe, the Cyclops, Poseidon, Calypso, the Sirens, and others.</p>

<p>Summary : This dramatic adaptation of Homer&#8217;s myth begins with a modern young woman who is struggling to understand Robert Fitzgerald&#8217;s translation of The Odyssey. A classical muse appears, and the young woman becomes the goddess Athena&#8211;a tireless advocate for Odysseus in his struggle to get home. With her trademark irreverent and witty twist on classic works, Zimmerman brings to life the story of Odysseus&#8217;s ten-year journey, depicting his encounters with characters such as Circe, the Cyclops, Poseidon, Calypso, the Sirens, and others.</p>

<p>Summary : Alternate cover edition for ASIN B075649VRHFor previous cover edition go hereFrom International Bestseller Michelle Heard, comes a new, sexy novel in the Enemies To Lovers series.I?m warned that Carter Hayes is heartless.He?s part of the screw crew.He?ll just use you and leave you.He?s ruthless and always gets what he wants.Just look for the trail of broken hearts and dreamy sighs, and you?ll find him. ?Hot as sin, Carter.? I don?t have time to fall head over heels for any guy. Besides, he?d never notice someone like me. I have a three-step plan. Get through college. Get a job. Get my sister out of the hell hole I left her in. That?s all I have time for. That?s until I hear of the betting pool the guys started. Whoever screws me first gets the money. The moment Carter looks at me, I know it?s only because of the bet. I tell myself our first kiss is only for show.I hate my heart for falling for his irresistible charm.For one foolish moment, I actually want him to be my first </p>

<p>Summary : Jake Wind is trying to stay under the radar. Whose radar? Anyone who might be too interested in the fact that he has shapeshifting abilities he can?t control. Or that his parents found him as a ball of goo when he was a baby.Keeping his powers in check is crucial, though, if he wants to live a normal life and go to middle school instead of being homeschooled (and if he wants to avoid being kidnapped and experimented on, of course).Things feel like they?re going his way when he survives his first day of school without transforming and makes a new friend. But when mysterious sinkholes start popping up around town?sinkholes filled with the same extraterrestrial substance as Jake?and his neighbors, classmates, and even his family start acting a little, well, weird, Jake will have to learn to use his powers in order to save his town.?</p>

Or that his parents found him as a ball of goo when he was a baby.Keeping his powers in check is crucial, though, if he wants to live a normal life and go to middle school instead of being homeschooled (and if he wants to avoid being kidnapped and experimented on, of course).Things feel like they?re going his way when he survives his first day of school without transforming and makes a new friend. But when mysterious sinkholes start popping up around town?sinkholes filled with the same extraterrestrial substance as Jake?and his neighbors, classmates, and even his family start acting a little, well, weird, Jake will have to learn to use his powers in order to save his town.?</p>

<p>Summary : I might be the only unmated female in my tribe, but it doesn?t mean I?ve given my heart. I?m waiting. I want resonance, and I won?t settle for anything less.  ?But when an alien ship lands and a handsome stranger steps out, I know he?s the one. His name?s Mardok and he?s fascinatingly different ? and distractingly appealing. But Mardok can?t stay on the ice planet, and he says he can take me with him.  ?Now, I must make a choice. Do I stay and lose my mate forever? Or do I follow him to the stars and leave behind everything I know??</p>

<p>Summary : Fencing prodigy Jess Kidman has always been ahead of her peers. At the age of thirteen she made the varsity team, won a state championship, came out, and fell head over heels in love with her team captain, Lauren Standish. After being gently rebuffed by the high school senior, young Jess vowed she would return for her some day when their age difference became irrelevant and her own accomplishments made her not merely an equal, but an Olympian. Eleven years later, Jess makes good on her promise, but when she arrives back in Buffalo a few months before the big games, she?s intrigued to find that the woman she?s always dreamed of could also be exactly the coach she needs to win gold. Lauren, however, isn?t the bubbly team captain she?d been at eighteen. After a stellar collegiate career of her own, circumstances forced her to her dreams on the shelf and return to Buffalo. She?d made peace with a quiet life spent running a rustbelt fencing club and coaching kids when Team USA?s hottest </p>

<p>Summary : The first three novels in New York Times bestselling author Peter V. Brett?s groundbreaking Demon Cycle series?The Warded Man, The Desert Spear, and The Daylight War?set a new standard for heroic fantasy. The powerful saga of humans winnowed to the brink of extinction by night-stalking demons, and the survivors who fight back, has kept readers breathless as they eagerly turned the pages. Now the thrilling fourth volume, The Skull Throne, raises the stakes as it carries the action in shocking new directions. The Skull Throne of Krasia stands empty. Built from the skulls of fallen generals and demon princes, it is a seat of honor and ancient, powerful magic, keeping the demon corelings at bay. From atop the throne, Ahmann Jardir was meant to conquer the known world, forging its isolated peoples into a unified army to rise up and end the demon war once and for all. But Arlen Bales, the Warded Man, stood against this course, challenging Jardir to a duel he could not in honor refuse. </p>
