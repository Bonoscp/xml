<p>Summary : Alexis Sky Martine thinks of herself as the average girl-next-door that does what she has to do to get by, have fun and enjoy life. She is madly in love with her sexy, drop-your-panties-at-first-sight, hottie boyfriend who is equally in love with her; more like downright obsessed. He treats her like she is his heart; like he needs her to exist; like he would do anything in his power to make her happy.Lexi knows Landyn James loves her just as much as she loves him, if not more.

He treats her like she is his heart; like he needs her to exist; like he would do anything in his power to make her happy.Lexi knows Landyn James loves her just as much as she loves him, if not more. Deep down, she also knows high school sweethearts aren?t expected to last, but their relationship is different. They are soul mates.

<p>Summary : In the 4th century AD, a new faith exploded out of Palestine. Overwhelming the paganism of Rome, and converting the Emperor Constantine in the process, it resoundingly defeated a host of other rivals. Almost a thousand years later, all of Europe was controlled by Christian rulers, and the religion, ingrained within culture and society, exercised a hold over its population. This was medieval Christendom: a springboard for the great eras of European colonisation and imperialism that followed. But, Peter Heather shows in this compelling new history, there was nothing inevitable about Christendom&#8217;s rise and eventual dominance.In exploring how the Christian religion became such a defining feature of the European landscape, and how a small sect of isolated and intensely committed congregations was transformed into a mass movement centrally directed from Rome, Peter Heather shows how Christendom constantly battled against threats both from inside &#8211; so-called &#8216;heresies&#8217; and other forms of </p>

<p>Summary : Sufism, called the mystical dimension of Islam, is known for its inclusive nature, as well as its ethics of love and compassion, its devotional music, art and architecture. In India&#8217;s syncretic culture, Sufism developed a distinct character, and harmoniously embraced the Bhakti traditions of North India.Rana Safvi&#8217;s In Search of the Divine delves into the fascinating roots of Sufism, with its emphasis on ihsan, iman and akhlaq, and the impact it continues to have on people from all communities. Safvi relies not only on textual sources but also on her own visits to dargahs across the country, and the conversations she has with devotees and pirs alike. The book evokes in vivid detail the sacred atmosphere she encounters &#8211; the reverent crowds, the strains of qawwali and the fragrance of incense, as well as highlights the undeniable yet often forgotten contributions of women in Sufism. The resulting text is at once modern and a tribute to the rich and textured past.Weaving together fact </p>

<p>Summary : When Nic, a slave in the mines outside of Rome, is forced to enter a sealed cavern containing the lost treasures of Julius Caesar, he finds much more than gold and gemstones: He discovers an ancient bulla, an amulet that belonged to the great Caesar and is filled with a magic once reserved for the Gods &#8212; magic some Romans would kill for.Now, with the deadly power of the bulla pulsing through his veins, Nic is determined to become free. But instead, he finds himself at the center of a ruthless conspiracy to overthrow the emperor and spark the Praetor War, a battle to destroy Rome from within. Traitors and spies lurk at every turn, each more desperate than the next to use Nic&#8217;s newfound powers for their own dark purposes.In a quest to stop the rebellion, save Rome, and secure his own freedom, Nic must harness the magic within himself and defeat the empire&#8217;s most powerful and savage leaders.</p>

<p>Summary : Karma?s coming for me. I never meant to screw over New York?s most notorious billionaire playboy. I?m just your average good girl, really. I play by the rules. But when push comes to shove, and my back is against the wall, I make questionable choices.I thought I?d never lay eyes on him again after that night.Boy, was I wrong. Fate has a sick sense of humor.Now here he is?Connor Quinn, the brooding billionaire I betrayed?glaring at me as our newest PR client.There?s no way this is going to end well for me.Connor?s eyes burn with intense vengeance, promising he won?t stop until he gets his payback. And damn, he looks like he?s going to enjoy every minute of it.I?m so screwed. And not in the fun way.But here?s the thing: Connor Quinn may be sinfully hot when he?s angry but I?m not going down without a fight.Empire State Enemies is a dual-point-of-view, standalone, enemies-to-lovers romance with spice, banter, and a happily ever after.</p>

<p>Summary : Roland Barthes?s 1967 essay, &#8220;The Death of the Author,&#8221; argues against the traditional practice of incorporating the intentions and biographical context of an author into textual interpretation because of the resultant limitations imposed on a text. Hailing &#8220;the birth of the reader,&#8221; Barthes posits a new abstract notion of the reader as the conceptual space containing all the text?s possible meanings. The essay has become one of the most cited works in literary criticism and is a key text for any reader approaching reader response theory.</p>

<p>Summary : Thomas Sankara (1949?87) was one of the most important anti-imperialist leaders of twentieth-century Africa. His declaration that fundamental change would require ?a certain amount of madness? was a driving force behind the Burkinab? Revolution that eventually led to his being elected president of Burkina Faso. ??????????? This book examines Sankara?s political philosophies and legacies and their relevance today. Amber Murrey analyzes his synthesis of Pan-Africanism and humanist Marxist politics, as well as his approach to gender, development, ecology, and decolonization. She doesn?t shy away from detailing the limitations of the revolution he led, but nonetheless she finds potent sources of inspiration for today?s struggles in Sankara?s example.</p>

<p>Summary : Thomas Sankara (1949?87) was one of the most important anti-imperialist leaders of twentieth-century Africa. His declaration that fundamental change would require ?a certain amount of madness? was a driving force behind the Burkinab? Revolution that eventually led to his being elected president of Burkina Faso. ??????????? This book examines Sankara?s political philosophies and legacies and their relevance today. Amber Murrey analyzes his synthesis of Pan-Africanism and humanist Marxist politics, as well as his approach to gender, development, ecology, and decolonization. She doesn?t shy away from detailing the limitations of the revolution he led, but nonetheless she finds potent sources of inspiration for today?s struggles in Sankara?s example.</p>

A collection of twelve birthday stories from some of the most distinguished writers of western literature.What will you get for your birthday this year? A chance to see into the future?

<p>Summary : Hopes. Dreams. And literal nightmares out to kill a young boy.Gray Lexly, son of a candlemaker, wants to escape his life of old-world technologies and study at the prestigious Astra Academy, a school for arcanists?those who can wield magic. But Gray has a major problem. Every night, as he sleeps, he?s visited by monsters. When they injure Gray in his dreams, he wakes with the same wounds in real life?On the night Gray might finally die in his nightmares, he is saved by the kind and mysterious Professor Helmith, a powerful arcanist. She offers to protect Gray and invites him to attend Astra Academy.Before that can happen, Gray must bond with a mystical creature to become an arcanist himself. Will he bond with a unicorn? A pegasus? A kitsune? Whatever he bonds with will determine his magical abilities, so he must choose wisely.And when trouble finds Professor Helmith, Gray must become powerful enough to help her and fend off the terrible nightmares, before it?s too late?</p>

<p>Summary : Three thrilling titles from one of America&#8217;s most popular bestselling authors, together in a special value collection. <br />
  A Time to Kill <br />
 &#8211; For ten days, with burning crosses and the crack of sniper fire spreading through the streets of Clanton, the nation sits spellbound as young defense attorney Jake Brigance struggles to save his client&#8217;s life&#8230;and then his own&#8230; <br />
  The Firm <br />
 &#8211; When Mitch McDeere, an ambitious law student from Harvard chooses the Memphis tax firm of Bendini, Lambert &amp; Locke, he finds himself caught between the FBI, who wants an informant inside the firm, and the firm itself, which will make him a very rich man-or a very dead one. <br />
  The Client <br />
 &#8211; This is the story of eleven-year-old Mark Sway, who witnessed the bizarre suicide of a New Orleans attorney. Just before he dies, the lawyer tells Mark a deadly secret concerning the recent murder of a Louisiana senator whose accused killer, Mafia thug Barry Muldanno, is about to go to trial.</p>

<p>Summary : Three thrilling titles from one of America&#8217;s most popular bestselling authors, together in a special value collection. <br />
  A Time to Kill <br />
 &#8211; For ten days, with burning crosses and the crack of sniper fire spreading through the streets of Clanton, the nation sits spellbound as young defense attorney Jake Brigance struggles to save his client&#8217;s life&#8230;and then his own&#8230; <br />
  The Firm <br />
 &#8211; When Mitch McDeere, an ambitious law student from Harvard chooses the Memphis tax firm of Bendini, Lambert &amp; Locke, he finds himself caught between the FBI, who wants an informant inside the firm, and the firm itself, which will make him a very rich man-or a very dead one. <br />
  The Client <br />
 &#8211; This is the story of eleven-year-old Mark Sway, who witnessed the bizarre suicide of a New Orleans attorney. Just before he dies, the lawyer tells Mark a deadly secret concerning the recent murder of a Louisiana senator whose accused killer, Mafia thug Barry Muldanno, is about to go to trial.</p>

<p>Summary : A twisting, haunting true-life murder mystery about one of the most monstrous crimes in American history ? In the 1920s, the richest people per capita in the world were members of the Osage Indian Nation in Oklahoma. After oil was discovered beneath their land, the Osage rode in chauffeured automobiles, built mansions, and sent their children to study in Europe.Then, one by one, they began to be killed off. One Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, watched as her family was murdered. Her older sister was shot. Her mother was then slowly poisoned. And it was just the beginning, as more Osage began to die under mysterious circumstances. In this last remnant of the Wild West?where oilmen like J. P. Getty made their fortunes and where desperadoes such as Al Spencer, ?the Phantom Terror,? roamed ? virtually anyone who dared to investigate the killings were themselves murdered. As the death toll surpassed more than twenty-four Osage, the newly created F.B.I. took up the case, in what became one of </p>

<p>Summary : From one of America&#8217;s most acclaimed comics writers a startlingly original look at life on the streets of Baghdad during the Iraq War inspired by true events. In the spring of 2003, a pride of lions escaped from the Baghdad Zoo during an American bombing raid. Lost and confused, hungry but finally free, the four lions roamed the decimated streets of Baghdad in a desperate struggle for their lives. In documenting the plight of the lions, Pride of Baghdad raises questions about the true meaning of liberation &#8211; can it be given, or is it earned only through self-determination and sacrifice? And in the end, is it truly better to die free than to live life in captivity? Based on a true story, Vaughan and Henrichon have created a unique and heartbreaking window into the nature of life during wartime, illuminating this struggle as only the graphic novel can.</p>

<p>Summary : This book discusses India?s decision to build a nuclear bomb and unravels the history and consequences of that decision, which was made in secrecy. India decided to begin nuclear tests in the late 1960s, and tension grew when Pakistan successfully launched a long range missile called Ghauri in the 1990s. Based on almost 200 interviews with participants, the author focuses on what happened and who knew about which aspects of the project, carrying the story forward to the late 1990s. The phrase ?weapons of peace? is used to refer to nuclear weapons, because in India the people see the weapons as important in deterring war and keeping India a free state. The book flows nicely and allows readers who are not scientists to understand India?s nuclear history.</p>

<p>Summary : The king loves to run and jump and ride his horse &#8211; but he also loves to eat. Soon he is too fat to run, jump and ride his horse and the delicious dishes prepared by his cooks no longer seem so good. One night he is really sick from over-eating and he sacks the cooks. As he feels better and a little hungry he is upset when he is unable to find anyone who can make him breakfast. The next day the stable boy finds the king hungry and sad and gives him his lunch &#8211; brown bread and honey! From then on the two lunch together and soon the king is able to run, jump and ride his horse again.</p>

<p>Summary : This book-first published a decade before the COVID-19 pandemic erupted-is the first authored volume on ethical issues in infectious disease, &#8220;monumental&#8221; for its competence and comprehensiveness. It is augmented here with a new Preface on COVID-19. The book develops an ethical framework for exploring contagious infectious disease, the patient-as-victim-and-vector view, grounded in the biological fact that a person with a communicable infectious disease is not only a victim of that disease, but at the same time also a potential vector. The patient may be both threatened, someone made ill or facing death, but also a threat, someone who may transmit an illness that will sicken or kill others. Clinical medicine has tended to see one part of this duality and public health the other; the victim-AND-vector view insists on both, at one and the same time.Against a background of methods from the long human history of contagious infectious disease-quarantine, isolation, cordon sanitaire, </p>

<p>Summary : Shot outside the offices of MI6 and left for dead by Scorpia, Alex Rider awakens in a top-secret hospital, glad simply to be alive. But danger has a way of following Alex, and when the boy in the next room is the victim of a kidnapping attempt, it is Alex who saves him; only to be kidnapped himself. The man behind the kidnapping? None other than Nikolei Drevin, wealthiest developer in the world, and the man who single-handedly is funding the first luxury hotel in outer space, Ark Angel. Yet the project is hemorrhaging millions of dollars along the way, and Drevin will stop at nothing to cease the bleeding. Even if it means blowing up Ark Angel. Even if it means sacrificing his only son. . . .</p>

<p>Summary : There are few women in English history more famous or controversial than Queen Anne Boleyn. She was the second wife of Henry VIII, mother of Elizabeth I and the first English queen to be publicly executed. Much of what we think we know about her is colored by myth and legend, and does not stand up to close scrutiny. Reinvented by each new generation, Anne is buried beneath centuries of labels: homewrecker, seductress, opportunist, witch, romantic victim, Protestant martyr, feminist. In this vivid and engaging account of the triumphant and harrowing final year of Queen Anne Boleyn&#8217;s life, the author reveals a very human portrait of a brilliant, passionate and complex woman.The last twelve months of Anne&#8217;s life contained both joy and heartbreak. This telling period bore witness to one of the longest and most politically significant progresses of Henry VIII&#8217;s reign, improved relations between the royal couple, and Anne&#8217;s longed-for pregnancy. With the dawning of the new year, the </p>

<p>Summary : An uplifting, adventure-filled memoir about a groundbreaking female scientist on a quest to develop new ways to fight illness and disease through the healing powers of plants. Dr. Cassandra Quave is a leading medical ethnobotanist&#8211;someone who identifies and studies plants that may be able to treat antimicrobial resistance and other threatening illnesses&#8211; helping to provide clues for the next generation of advanced medicines. In The Plant Hunter, Dr. Quave weaves together science, botany, and memoir to tell us the extraordinary story of her own journey. Traveling by canoe, ATV, mule, airboat, and on foot, she has conducted field research in the flooded forests of the remote Amazon, the murky swamps of southern Florida, the rolling hills of central Italy, isolated mountaintops in Albania and Kosovo, and volcanic isles arising out of the Mediterranean?all in search of natural compounds, long-known to traditional healers, that could help save us all from the looming crisis of </p>

<p>Summary : Una impresionante descripci?n del cosmos. ?Qu? podr?amos hacer con un suministro de energ?a gratuita e inagotable?Los habitantes de un universo paralelo en el futuro, con leyes f?sicas ligeramente distintas a las nuestras, descubren la forma de intercambiar materia con nosotros. Materia que, una vez en el universo de destino, y merced a las diferencias f?sicas entre ambos, comienza a desprender energ?a de forma espont?nea. Una vez consumida la capacidad energ?tica del material, ?ste puede volver a ser intercambiado, para recomenzar el ciclo. ?Qu? podr?amos hacer con un suministro de energ?a gratuita e inagotable? M?s all? que cualquier otra historia, esta novela destaca por una impresionante descripci?n del cosmos, una visi?n que nos hace a?n m?s insignificantes de lo que pod?amos pensar. Con una gran maestr?a, Asimov nos va sumergiendo en un universo totalmente diferente al que conocemos. Un derroche de imaginaci?n pocas veces realizado.</p>

<p>Summary : Una impresionante descripci?n del cosmos. ?Qu? podr?amos hacer con un suministro de energ?a gratuita e inagotable?Los habitantes de un universo paralelo en el futuro, con leyes f?sicas ligeramente distintas a las nuestras, descubren la forma de intercambiar materia con nosotros. Materia que, una vez en el universo de destino, y merced a las diferencias f?sicas entre ambos, comienza a desprender energ?a de forma espont?nea. Una vez consumida la capacidad energ?tica del material, ?ste puede volver a ser intercambiado, para recomenzar el ciclo. ?Qu? podr?amos hacer con un suministro de energ?a gratuita e inagotable? M?s all? que cualquier otra historia, esta novela destaca por una impresionante descripci?n del cosmos, una visi?n que nos hace a?n m?s insignificantes de lo que pod?amos pensar. Con una gran maestr?a, Asimov nos va sumergiendo en un universo totalmente diferente al que conocemos. Un derroche de imaginaci?n pocas veces realizado.</p>

She knows she can&#8217;t just say whatever thought comes into her head . . . but sometimes she can&#8217;t help herself.

Other kids are starting to notice. When Clea fails one too many tests, her parents take her to be tested, and she finds out that she has ADHD, which means her attention is all over the place instead of where it needs to be.Clea knows life can&#8217;t continue the way it&#8217;s been going.

<p>Summary : Seventy years ago, thousands of North American workers took a stand for a better life. And they won. In 1946, in the United States, over a million workers in the steel, meatpacking, and electrical industries put down their tools and walked out; and striking Canadian workers tied up provincial rubber and logging industries, the Southam newspaper chain, central Canadian ports, and the national steel industry. Workers in Hamilton, Ontario hoisted picket signs at Westinghouse, Firestone, Stelco, and The Hamilton Spectator, and with the support of rallying friends and neighbours, turned the strikes into a community-wide struggle for decency, respect, and security.Based on interviews and other archival materials, this graphic history illustrates how Hamilton workers translated their experience of work and organizing in the 1930s and early 1940s into a new kind of unionism and a new North American society in the decades following World War II.</p>

<p>Summary : In &#8216;YOUR DOG IS YOUR MIRROR&#8217;, dog trainer Kevin Behan proposes a radical new model for understanding canine behavior: a dog&#8217;s behavior and emotion, indeed its very cognition, are driven by our emotion.

But he eventually came to believe that what made the modern dog trainable was not the dominance hierarchy but the dog&#8217;s ability to work as a cooperative group member in the hunt. This ability then evolved into an emotional capacity that perfectly complements human emotion.Behan demonstrates that dogs are connected more profoundly than has ever been imagined &#8211; by heart &#8211; and that this approach to dog cognition can help us understand many of </p>

<p>Summary : Londyn McCormack didn?t have a typical childhood. She ran away from home at sixteen, escaping parents more interested in drugs than their daughter. She doesn?t have loving siblings or an adorable pet. Her only family is the five other runaway kids who shared her junkyard home.  Life pulled them all in separate directions, taking her to Boston. For a short time, she thought she?d found something permanent. But after a devastating divorce, she?s running away again, this time to find a lost friend. She?s driving across the country in her convertible. As a teenager, the rusty car was her shelter. As an adult, it?s her ride to freedom.  Except one flat tire derails her trip. Her life collides with Brooks Cohen. They walked away from the first crash. The second might destroy them both.</p>

<p>Summary : There is a significant divide between autistic advocates and parents of autistic children. Parents may feel attacked for their lack of understanding, and autistic adults who offer insight and guidance are also met with hostility and rejection.Meghan Ashburn, a mother of two autistic boys, and Jules Edwards, an autistic parent, were no strangers to this tension and had an adversarial relationship when they first met. Over time, the two resolved their differences and are now co-conspirators in the pursuit of disability justice.This book unites both perspectives, exploring the rift between these communities and encouraging them to work towards a common goal. It provides context to dividing issues, and the authors use their experience to illustrate where they&#8217;ve messed up, where they&#8217;ve got things right, and what they&#8217;ve learned along the way.</p>

<p>Summary : In 1885 Jane and Leland Stanford cofounded a university to honor their recently deceased young son. After her husband?s death in 1893, Jane Stanford, a devoted spiritualist who expected the university to inculcate her values, steered Stanford into eccentricity and public controversy for more than a decade.

<p>Summary : THIS IS A RIVETING AND DISTURBING ACCOUNT OF THE MEDICAL ATROCITIES PERFORMED IN CHINA DURING WWII.Some of the cruelest deeds of Japan&#8217;s war in Asia did not occur on the battlefield, but in quiet, antiseptic medical wards in obscure parts of China. Far from front lines and prying eyes, Japanese doctors and their assistants subjected human guinea pigs to gruesome medical experiments in the name of science and Japan&#8217;s wartime chemical and biological warfare research.Author Hal Gold draws upon a wealth of sources to construct a portrait of the Imperial Japanese Army&#8217;s most notorious medical unit, giving an overview of its history and detailing its most shocking activities. The book presents the words of former unit members themselves, taken from remarks they made at a traveling Unit 731 exhibition held in Japan in 1994-95. They recount vivid first-hand memories of what it was like to take part in horrific experiments on men, women and children, their motivations and reasons why they </p>

<p>Summary : F?r Neurowissenschaftlerin Bee ist die Liebe nur ein neurophysiologischer Zwischenfall, hoffnungslos instabil und der wahre B?sewicht menschlicher Beziehungen, deren neuronale Grundlagen sie erforscht. Als Frau in den Naturwissenschaften ist Bee eine bedrohte Art in einer von M?nnern beherrschten Welt, in der f?r sie stets gilt: Was w?rde Marie Curie tun? Dann wird ihr die Leitung eines neurotechnischen Wunschprojekts angeboten ? was Marie Curie sofort annehmen w?rde. Aber die musste auch nie mit Levi Ward zusammenarbeiten, Bees langj?hrigem akademischem Erzfeind, der ihren Traum zum Projekt des Grauens macht. Bis Bee sich pl?tzlich in eine v?llig irrational romantische Zwangslage verstrickt findet, in der nur noch z?hlt: Was wird Bee tun?</p>

<p>Summary : I?m in love with three men. I?m just not sure if they?re a dream come true or my worst nightmare.It began with hearing voices &#8211; another step on my steady descent into madness. It was inevitable, considering the whole town hated me and I was the loneliest person on the planet.I didn?t really blame them. Everyone who got close to me ended up in the hospital. I?d be suspicious of me too.When the three distinct, alluring voices in my head started to appear before my eyes as three distinct, gorgeous men I really started to question everything I thought I knew.They called themselves Dreamwalkers and told me they were hunting the monster attacking all the people around me.They won?t leave me alone.I?m not sure I want them to.But am I the monster they?re after? Or are we all in worse danger than I ever could?ve imagined?</p>

<p>Summary : As Inspector Jefe Javier Falc?n investigates a faceless, mutilated corpse, the beautiful city of Seville is rocked by a massive explosion. The discovery of a mosque in the basement of a devastated apartment building confirms everybody?s terrorist fears. Panic sweeps the city and the region goes on red alert. As more bodies are dragged from the rubble, the media interest and political pressure inten?sify and Falc?n suspects that all is not what it appears to be. Just as he comes close to cracking the conspiracy, he makes the most terrifying discovery of all and the race is on to prevent a catastrophe far beyond Spain?s borders.? A masterful thriller, The Hidden Assassins is fiction of the highest order.</p>

<p>Summary : You can?t fly without falling, so close your eyes and let go. People ask me if I?m human. If I have feelings. If I?ve ever loved anyone. I?m the lawyer who has never lost a case because I have nothing else to live for. Until Jonah. He?s my complete opposite: a reckless boy twelve years younger than me, made of sunshine and wicked smiles, pure and breathtaking. It all starts with a secret. He wants to find out if he?s bi, and he begs me to teach him because we?ll never see each other again. Until he becomes my intern. I can?t draw lines faster than we blur them. He?s the unstoppable force; I?m the immovable object. When we collide, things get filthy. Complicated. More beautiful than I ever could have imagined. He?s the only person ever to learn the truth: I?ve always been human. I?ve always had feelings. I?ve been so, so afraid to lose. Because the moment we find enough trust to jump is the moment we realize our wings might be too broken to fly.A heartfelt, emotional story of two </p>

<p>Summary : You can?t fly without falling, so close your eyes and let go. People ask me if I?m human. If I have feelings. If I?ve ever loved anyone. I?m the lawyer who has never lost a case because I have nothing else to live for. Until Jonah. He?s my complete opposite: a reckless boy twelve years younger than me, made of sunshine and wicked smiles, pure and breathtaking. It all starts with a secret. He wants to find out if he?s bi, and he begs me to teach him because we?ll never see each other again. Until he becomes my intern. I can?t draw lines faster than we blur them. He?s the unstoppable force; I?m the immovable object. When we collide, things get filthy. Complicated. More beautiful than I ever could have imagined. He?s the only person ever to learn the truth: I?ve always been human. I?ve always had feelings. I?ve been so, so afraid to lose. Because the moment we find enough trust to jump is the moment we realize our wings might be too broken to fly.A heartfelt, emotional story of two </p>

<p>Summary : National bestselling author of APOCALYPSE NEVER skewers progressives for the mishandling of America?s faltering cities.?Progressives claimed they knew how to solve homelessness, inequality, and crime. But in cities they control, progressives made those problems worse.Michael Shellenberger has lived in the San Francisco Bay Area for thirty years. During that time, he advocated for the decriminalization of drugs, affordable housing, and alternatives to jail and prison. But as homeless encampments spread, and overdose deaths skyrocketed, Shellenberger decided to take a closer look at the problem.What he discovered shocked him. The problems had grown worse not despite but because of progressive policies. San Francisco and other West Coast cities ? Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland ? had gone beyond merely tolerating homelessness, drug dealing, and crime to actively enabling them.San Fransicko reveals that the underlying problem isn?t a lack of housing or money for social programs.

But in cities they control, progressives made those problems worse.Michael Shellenberger has lived in the San Francisco Bay Area for thirty years. During that time, he advocated for the decriminalization of drugs, affordable housing, and alternatives to jail and prison. But as homeless encampments spread, and overdose deaths skyrocketed, Shellenberger decided to take a closer look at the problem.What he discovered shocked him. The problems had grown worse not despite but because of progressive policies. San Francisco and other West Coast cities ? Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland ? had gone beyond merely tolerating homelessness, drug dealing, and crime to actively enabling them.San Fransicko reveals that the underlying problem isn?t a lack of housing or money for social programs.

<p>Summary : Topaz Winters? third poetry collection spans three countries &amp; three generations. In a far-reaching &amp; deftly-woven series of ars poeticas, Winters questions the boundary between the things we inherit &amp; those we owe, stands at the grave of the American dream, &amp; unspools the enormous grace &amp; guilt of being loved. So, Stranger stands as a fixed mark between the shifting histories &amp; futures of being a daughter, being an artist, &amp; being an immigrant. If its reader begins as a stranger, they end as part of a lineage: one both of grief &amp; glory, of distance &amp; arrival.</p>

<p>Summary : All are made in the image and likeness of God. If this is what we believe, then trans people, like all people, reflect something of God, and not just in the ways that they share in common with others, but also in the ways that they are different. They remind us that God is beyond all of our categories, even gender. In this book, Tara Soughers explores theology from the position of a trans ally?a parent of a trans young adult as well as priest. What does it mean about God and about humans, that there is not a strict gender binary? How can we affirm and include what we have learned about the permeability of boundaries to affirm those whose path does not follow traditional cultural stereotypes, and how might the broadening help us to understand the God who is never two for Christians, but both one and three? What gifts does this broader understanding bring to the church?</p>

<p>Summary : Thousands of people have had near-death experiences, but scientists have argued that they are impossible. Dr. Eben Alexander was one of those scientists. A highly trained neurosurgeon, Alexander knew that NDEs feel real, but are simply fantasies produced by brains under extreme stress.Then, Dr. Alexander?s own brain was attacked by a rare illness. The part of the brain that controls thought and emotion?and in essence makes us human?shut down completely. For seven days he lay in a coma. Then, as his doctors considered stopping treatment, Alexander?s eyes popped open. He had come back.Alexander?s recovery is a medical miracle. But the real miracle of his story lies elsewhere. While his body lay in coma, Alexander journeyed beyond this world and encountered an angelic being who guided him into the deepest realms of super-physical existence. There he met, and spoke with, the Divine source of the universe itself.Alexander?s story is not a fantasy. Before he underwent his journey, he could </p>

<p>Summary : La vita va in una direzione precisa. Dalla A alla Z, dal principio alla fine. Questa storia invece va al contrario, dalla Z di Zeno, libraio, sognatore, eterno studente, alla A di Ana, sessantenne che ha fatto il sindaco del suo paese per una vita, e ora ? pronta a cominciare a vivere davvero. Li incontriamo a inizio della storia che si ritrovano, dopo anni, emozionati come ragazzini. Li ritroviamo, alla fine del libro, che si incontrano per la prima volta, perch? in questo libro di Jordi Lafebre i capitoli sono numerati da 20 a 1, e la storia d?amore di Ana e Zeno ? raccontata in ordine inverso, ma se gli anni diminuiscono, man mano che la lettura procede le emozioni aumentano. Un racconto perfetto, che sa raccontare i complessi incastri del cuore.</p>

<p>Summary : You can&#8217;t get what you unless you ask for it!&#8221;My favorite thing when I&#8217;m working with clients is when their eyes go wide with the &#8216;ah-ha&#8217; moment that they really can have the sex life of their dreams. It&#8217;s my hope that with this book, you can as well.&#8221;&#8211;Stella HarrisSex is still a touchy subject despite recent sex-positive advances. We live in a culture that vilifies people who are sexually adventurous and frames our kinks as shame-inducing perversions. Many people have never been able to talk openly about sex with their partner(s). But, you can get what you want out of the bedroom&#8211;if you ask for it. Why should anyone settle for mediocre sex?!Whether addressing sexual frustration with your partner, trying out new fantasies, or negotiating the terms of a BDSM scene, Stella Harris believes that communication skills are vital to sexual fulfillment. Tongue Tied gives readers straightforward advice on how to conquer their fears, identify their needs, and feel positively empowered. Harris </p>

<p>Summary : Object orientation is a lie. Reusable, flexible components have failed. The SOLID Principles of Object-Oriented Design still cling to these lies, sending developers down so many wrong paths. In less than 70 pages, this book presents five broadsides against each principle, tracing their history, demonstrating their flaws, and taking their advice to an hilarious degree all to prove a point: you can build good software by focusing on the problem at hand, and discussing the code you&#8217;re writing, not some nebulous set of principles.</p>

His coming was not foretold.He bleeds like any man, and bleed he will. </p>

<p>Summary : Over the years, startling evidence has been unearthed, challenging established notions of the origins of Earth and life on it and suggesting the existence of a superior race of beings who once inhabited our world. The product of thirty years of intensive research, The 12th Planet is the first book in Zecharia Sitchin&#8217;s prophetic Earth Chronicles series&#8211;a revolutionary body of work that offers indisputable documentary proof of humanity&#8217;s extraterrestrial forefathers. Travelers from the stars, they arrived eons ago, and planted the genetic seed that would ultimately blossom into a remarkable species . . . called Man. The 12th Planet brings to life the Sumerian civilization, presenting millennia-old evidence of the existence of Nibiru, the home planet of the Anunnaki and of the landings of the Anunnaki on Earth every 3,600 years, and reveals a complete history of the solar system as told by these early visitors from another planet.</p>

<p>Summary : Everyone knows appearances can be deceiving, and in my case, even I?ve been fooled.   The last thing I need is immature man-child, Alexander Bennet, trying to smile his way into my pants. I hate everything about him; his stupid smirk, his rumbling chuckle, and the way butterflies riot in my stomach when he aims them at me. Our sparring matches go from maddening to stimulating and suddenly my mind and body are at war.  Unfortunately for me, my life is nothing but lies. Twisted secrets keep throwing us together then pulling us apart as we try to unravel it.  Will the one person I want nothing to do with, be my salvation? Or are we doomed to tear each other apart?  *If you have triggers, please proceed with caution*</p>

The last thing I need is immature man-child, Alexander Bennet, trying to smile his way into my pants. I hate everything about him; his stupid smirk, his rumbling chuckle, and the way butterflies riot in my stomach when he aims them at me. Our sparring matches go from maddening to stimulating and suddenly my mind and body are at war. Unfortunately for me, my life is nothing but lies. Twisted secrets keep throwing us together then pulling us apart as we try to unravel it. Will the one person I want nothing to do with, be my salvation? Or are we doomed to tear each other apart? *If you have triggers, please proceed with caution* Discover the Bestseller Everyone is Talking About: Read Curves Ahead (Bennet Family #2) PDF , Reading Curves Ahead (Bennet Family #2) pdf , Curves Ahead (Bennet Family #2) Handbook , Curves Ahead (Bennet Family #2) read , Curves Ahead (Bennet Family #2) epub , Curves Ahead (Bennet Family #2) in English , Curves Ahead (Bennet Family #2) Kindle , Curves Ahead (Bennet Family #2) audiobook Curves Ahead (Bennet Family #2) Summary.

<p>Summary : Pledging the most powerful secret society in the world was always going to be difficult. Their Trials are legendary. Dangerous. Testing candidates in ways no one imagines.But what I don?t count on is being grouped together with three men who might hinder my real purpose.The tatted, reckless ?black sheep? would rather ruin me than build me up.The royal bad boy?s stalker-like obsession knows no bounds.Then there?s my gorgeous Economics professor who?s perfect on the outside but rotten in the middle.Who would?ve thought the biggest test of all was going to be staying away from them?I can?t trust them with my secret though. They?re part of the same social elite that I despise. They?re tethered to the organization I plan to destroy.However, my body and my brain aren?t always on the same page.If they strip me down to uncover my truths, I?ll be the next tragic headline.No one crosses the Knights and lives.???PRETTY SECRETS is the first book in a dark college RH romance series with a secret </p>

<p>Summary : A luminous guide to how the radical new science of counterfactuals can reveal the full scope of our universe. There is a vast class of properties, which science has so far neglected, that relate not only to what is true the actual but to what could be true: the counterfactual. This is the science of can and can&#8217;t.A pioneer in the field, Chiara Marletto explores the extraordinary promise that this revolutionary approach holds for confronting existing technological challenges, from delivering next-generation processors to designing AI. But by contemplating the possible as well as the actual, Marletto goes deeper still, showing how counterfactuals can break down barriers to knowledge and form a more complete, abundant and rewarding picture of the universe itself.</p>

<p>Summary : Kay Donovan may have skeletons in her closet, but the past is past, and she&#8217;s reinvented herself entirely. Now she&#8217;s a star soccer player whose group of gorgeous friends run their private school with effortless popularity and acerbic wit. But when a girl&#8217;s body is found in the lake, Kay&#8217;s carefully constructed life begins to topple. The dead girl has left Kay a computer-coded scavenger hunt, which, as it unravels, begins to implicate suspect after suspect, until Kay herself is in the crosshairs of a murder investigation. But if Kay&#8217;s finally backed into a corner, she&#8217;ll do what it takes to survive. Because at Bates Academy, the truth is something you make&#8230;not something that happened.</p>

The fourth Industrial Revolution is now replacing our brains. This technological shift is engulfing organisations and people. It&#8217;s challenging the very essence of what it means to be human. Daily news headlines pose existential questions that used to belong in the pages of science fiction: Will a machine take my job? Are we becoming cyborgs?

Innovation guru Greg Orme provides a helpful, funny and supportive shove in the right direction. He explores the skills you need to survive and thrive in a world of arti?cial intelligence.

<p>Summary : As Nahr sits, locked away in solitary confinement, she spends her days reflecting on the dramatic events that landed her in prison in a country she barely knows. Born in Kuwait in the 70s to Palestinian refugees, she dreamed of falling in love with the perfect man, raising children, and possibly opening her own beauty salon. Instead, the man she thinks she loves jilts her after a brief marriage, her family teeters on the brink of poverty, she?s forced to prostitute herself, and the US invasion of Iraq makes her a refugee, as her parents had been. After trekking through another temporary home in Jordan, she lands in Palestine, where she finally makes a home, falls in love, and her destiny unfolds under Israeli occupation.</p>

<p>Summary : Feminist City is an ongoing experiment in living differently, living better, and living more justly in an urban world.We live in the city of men. Our public spaces are not designed for female bodies. There is little consideration for women as mothers, workers or carers. The urban streets often are a place of threats rather than community. Gentrification has made the everyday lives of women even more difficult. What would a metropolis for working women look like? A city of friendships beyond Sex and the City. A transit system that accommodates mothers with strollers on the school run. A public space with enough toilets. A place where women can walk without harassment.In Feminist City, through history, personal experience, and popular culture, Leslie Kern exposes what is hidden in plain sight: the social inequalities built into our cities, homes, and neighborhoods. Kern offers an alternative vision of the feminist city. Taking on fear, motherhood, friendship, activism, and the joys and </p>

<p>Summary : A thrilling, sexy coming-of-age story exploring toxic love, ruthless ambition, and shocking betrayal, Tell Me Lies is about that one person who still haunts you?the other one. The wrong one. The one you couldn?t let go of. The one you?ll never forget.Lucy Albright is far from her Long Island upbringing when she arrives on the campus of her small California college, and happy to be hundreds of miles from her mother, whom she?s never forgiven for an act of betrayal in her early teen years. Quickly grasping at her fresh start, Lucy embraces college life and all it has to offer?new friends, wild parties, stimulating classes. And then she meets Stephen DeMarco. Charming. Attractive. Complicated. Devastating. Confident and cocksure, Stephen sees something in Lucy that no one else has, and she?s quickly seduced by this vision of herself, and the sense of possibility that his attention brings her. Meanwhile, Stephen is determined to forget an incident buried in his past that, if exposed, </p>

<p>Summary :  Discover the new Doctor Who classics. Still reeling from his encounter with the Cybermen, the First Doctor stumbles through the bitter Antarctic wind, resisting the approaching regeneration with all his strength. But as he fights his way through the snowdrifts, he comes across the familiar shape of a blue police box, and a mysterious figure who introduces himself as the Doctor?Thrown together at their most vulnerable moments, the two Doctors must discover why the snowflakes are suspended in the sky, why a First World War Captain has been lifted from his time stream moments before his death, and who is the mysterious Glass Woman who knows their true name. The Doctor is reunited with Bill, but is she all she seems? And can he hold out against the coming regeneration?</p>

<p>Summary : In 2010 world-renowned innovation expert Clayton M. Christensen gave a powerful speech to the Harvard Business School&#8217;s graduating class. Drawing upon his business research, he offered a series of guidelines for finding meaning and happiness in life. He used examples from his own experiences to explain how high achievers can all too often fall into traps that lead to unhappiness.The speech was memorable not only because it was deeply revealing but also because it came at a time of intense personal reflection: Christensen had just overcome the same type of cancer that had taken his father&#8217;s life. As Christensen struggled with the disease, the question &#8220;How do you measure your life?&#8221; became more urgent and poignant, and he began to share his insights more widely with family, friends, and students.In this groundbreaking book, Christensen puts forth a series of questions: How can I be sure that I&#8217;ll find satisfaction in my career? How can I be sure that my personalrelationships become </p>

He used examples from his own experiences to explain how high achievers can all too often fall into traps that lead to unhappiness.The speech was memorable not only because it was deeply revealing but also because it came at a time of intense personal reflection: Christensen had just overcome the same type of cancer that had taken his father&amp;#8217;s life. As Christensen struggled with the disease, the question &amp;#8220;How do you measure your life?&amp;#8221; became more urgent and poignant, and he began to share his insights more widely with family, friends, and students.In this groundbreaking book, Christensen puts forth a series of questions: How can I be sure that I&amp;#8217;ll find satisfaction in my career? How can I be sure that my personalrelationships become Discover the Bestseller Everyone is Talking About: Read How Will You Measure Your Life?

<p>Summary : Sulla Sicilia, sin da tempi antichissimi, si sono riversate ondate di civilt?. Ma i Greci vi hanno lasciato un carattere indelebile, che fa parte della natura profonda di questa terra. Gli d?i non se ne sono mai andati dall?isola. Nelle campagne assolate nel cuore dell?estate, per le strade aggrappate ai pennacchi di roccia delle montagne siciliane si pu? ancora sentire Eracle chiamare le sue mandrie e Ulisse ridere del Ciclope. Nel tramonto di Agrigento, di Selinunte, di Segesta abitano ancora le processioni in onore degli d?i. Quando il giorno chiama la notte, nei teatri di Siracusa e di Taormina, il racconto del mito, nella rappresentazione delle tragedie, ritrova la voce potente che dovette avere nel V secolo a.C., in Grecia e nell?Occidente greco. Terra rifugio di d?i e di eroi, di ninfe e di filosofi, di mostri e di re, la Sicilia ? l?incarnazione di quello straniamento magico e felice che tanto piaceva ai Greci. ? la stranizza di un mezzogiorno d?estate, con i cortili </p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;The Story of the Stone&#8221; (c. 1760) is one of the greatest novels of Chinese literature. The first part of the story, The Golden Days, begins the tale of Bao-yu, a gentle young boy who prefers girls to Confucian studies, and his two cousins: Bao-chai, his parents&#8217; choice of a wife for him, and the ethereal beauty Dai-yu. Through the changing fortunes of the Jia family, this rich, magical work sets worldly events &#8211; love affairs, sibling rivalries, political intrigues, even murder &#8211; within the context of the Buddhist understanding that earthly existence is an illusion and karma determines the shape of our lives.</p>

Ci sono dei dati di fatto che forse vi faranno pensare.Hanno arrestato i miei genitori con un provvedimento subito dopo annullato, hanno sequestrato i telefonini ai miei amici non indagati, hanno cambiato nomi nei documenti ufficiali per indagare sulle persone a me vicine, hanno scritto il falso in centinaia di articoli, hanno pubblicato lettere privatissime tra me e mio padre, mi hanno fotografato negli autogrill e mentre uscivo dal bagno di un aereo, hanno controllato e pubblicato tutte le voci del mio estratto conto, hanno violato la Costituzione per controllare i miei messaggi di whatsapp. Io non voglio fare la vittima. Voglio raccontare ci? che ? successo dicendo perch? ho scelto di combattere a viso aperto contro le ingiustizie. Perch? ho scelto di denunciare in sede civile e penale, convinto che la legge sia uguale per tutti. Per i politici, certo. Ma deve essere uguale </p>

<p>Summary : First published in 1963, The Stone Face tells the tale of a young African-American man who takes refuge from American racism in France, only to find himself complicit in a racist order of another sort. Simeon Brown, a journalist who, as a teenager, lost an eye in a racist attack, lives in his native Philadelphia in a state of agonizing tension, and after a violent encounter with some white sailors on shore leave, he decides to pack up and leave for Paris, known as a safe haven for black artists and intellectuals.

<p>Summary : Baby You Are My Religion argues that American butch-femme bar culture of the mid-20th Century should be interpreted as a sacred space for its community. Before Stonewall &#8212; when homosexuals were still deemed mentally ill &#8212; these bars were the only place where many could have any community at all. Baby, You are My Religion explores this community as a site of a lived corporeal theology and political space. It reveals that religious institutions such as the Metropolitan Community Church were founded in such bars, that traditional and non-traditional religious activities took place there, and that religious ceremonies such as marriage were often conducted within the bars by staff. Baby, You are My Religion examines how these bars became not only ecclesiastical sites but also provided the fertile ground for the birth of the struggle for gay and lesbian civil rights before Stonewall.</p>

<p>Summary : Combining three incredibly important books for the teaching of the Church, The Goldsworthy Trilogy offers a complete and comprehensive guide to understanding the gospel throughout the whole of Scripture. Hugely popular, this collection is being released in this special format and will be an essential guide to be used again and again for those who seek to understand the Bible in the light of who Jesus is. Straightforward in his approach, Goldsworthy looks at how the Bible can only be understood through the eyes of the gospel. This being the base of his interpretation, he studies the Old Testament and its application for today, Israels wisdom literature and its role in the Christian life and the purpose and contemporary relevance of the book of Revelation. This trilogy follows the Bible chronologically to give the reader a complete overview of evangelical biblical interpretation forming an essential one-stop reference that will last a lifetime.</p>

This trilogy follows the Bible chronologically to give the reader a complete overview of evangelical biblical interpretation forming an essential one-stop reference that will last a lifetime.</p>

<p>Summary : Little known in the English-speaking world, Burundi is Rwanda&#8217;s twin, a small Central African country with a complex history of ethnic tension between its Hutu and Tutsi populations that has itself experienced traumatic events, including mass killings of over 200,000 people. The country remained in a state of simmering civil war until 2004, after which Julius Nyerere and Nelson Mandela took turns as mediators in a lengthy, and eventually successful, peace process which has endowed Burundi with new institutions, including a new constitution, that led to the election of a majority Hutu government in 2005. But there are many problems still to solve apart from ethnic tensions, above all the entrenched poverty of most Burundians, which has seen it designated by NGOs as one of the most deprived countries on earth.Nigel Watt&#8217;s book discusses the troubled political fortunes of this beautiful yet disturbed country in the heart of Central Africa. He traces the origins of its political crises, </p>

<p>Summary : Fidel Castro emerges as an ambitious rebel, from his earliest years into his student years &amp; adulthood. In gripping detail, Quirk follows Castro as his 1st, failed attempt to bring down the regime of Fulgencio Batista is followed by the small-scale attacks from the Sierra Maestra mountains that culminate in the dictator&#8217;s flight from Cuba in 1959 &amp; Castro&#8217;s sweep into power. The story provides a new account of Castro&#8217;s relations with the USA &amp; the USSR, including the Bay of Pigs invasion &amp; the 1962 Missile Crisis, &amp; an analysis of the successes &amp; failures of his regime to the present day. In its breadth &amp; drama, Fidel Castro is more than the story of one ambitious man steering his nation on a dangerous course. It is also a parable of a small country caught up in the throes of international rivalries &amp; world revolution.</p>
