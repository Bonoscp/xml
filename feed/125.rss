<p>Summary : In this perennial bestseller, embraced by organizations and industries worldwide, globally preeminent management thinkers W. Chan Kim and Ren?e Mauborgne challenge everything you thought you knew about the requirements for strategic success. Recognized as one of the most iconic and impactful strategy books ever written, BLUE OCEAN STRATEGY, now updated with fresh content from the authors, argues that cutthroat competition results in nothing but a bloody red ocean of rivals fighting over a shrinking profit pool. Based on a study of 150 strategic moves (spanning more than 100 years across 30 industries), the authors argue that lasting success comes not from battling competitors but from creating &#8220;blue oceans&#8221;?untapped new market spaces ripe for growth.</p>

<p>Summary : One week with one little girl?an angel, according to my staffing agency. Acting as the short-term nanny for a single dad should have been an easy way to make some extra cash. Until I show up for my first day and face off with a demon disguised as a seven-year-old girl wearing a red tutu and matching glitter slippers.Oh, and her father? My temporary boss? Maddox Holiday. The same Maddox Holiday I crushed on in high school. The same Maddox Holiday who didn?t even know I existed. And the same Maddox Holiday who hasn?t set foot in Montana for years because he?s been too busy running his billionaire empire.Enduring seven days is going to feel like scaling the Himalayas in six-inch heels. Toss in the Holiday family?s annual soiree, and Christmas Eve nightmares really do come true. But I can do anything for a week, especially for this paycheck, even if it means wrangling the naughty, impressing the nice, and playing the nanny.</p>

<p>Summary : In 2010, the al Rabeeah family left their home in Iraq in hope of a safer life. They moved to Homs, in Syria ? just before the Syrian civil war broke out.Abu Bakr, one of eight children, was ten years old when the violence began on the streets around him: car bombings, attacks on his mosque and school, firebombs late at night. Homes tells of the strange juxtapositions of growing up in a war zone: horrific, unimaginable events punctuated by normalcy ? soccer, cousins, video games, friends.Homes is the remarkable true story of how a young boy emerged from a war zone ? and found safety in Canada ? with a passion for sharing his story and telling the world what is truly happening in Syria. As told to her by Abu Bakr al Rabeeah, writer Winnie Yeung has crafted a heartbreaking, hopeful, and urgently necessary book that provides a window into understanding Syria.</p>

<p>Summary : In 2010, the al Rabeeah family left their home in Iraq in hope of a safer life. They moved to Homs, in Syria ? just before the Syrian civil war broke out.Abu Bakr, one of eight children, was ten years old when the violence began on the streets around him: car bombings, attacks on his mosque and school, firebombs late at night. Homes tells of the strange juxtapositions of growing up in a war zone: horrific, unimaginable events punctuated by normalcy ? soccer, cousins, video games, friends.Homes is the remarkable true story of how a young boy emerged from a war zone ? and found safety in Canada ? with a passion for sharing his story and telling the world what is truly happening in Syria. As told to her by Abu Bakr al Rabeeah, writer Winnie Yeung has crafted a heartbreaking, hopeful, and urgently necessary book that provides a window into understanding Syria.</p>

<p>Summary : Manusia bilang di mana ada kehidupan, di situ ada harapan. Tapi bagiku, ruh yang telah dinasibkan di Lauhul Mahfudz, selama manusia memelihara harapan, maka aku akan selalu hidup.Dari Alam Rahim, aku menyaksikan bagaimana kedua orangtuaku jatuh bangun memerolehku. Melewati puluhan terapi, menghadapi ratusan jarum suntik, sayatan pisau operasi, berkali inseminasi dan gagal bayi tabung, bahkan sampai harus melalui badai depresi.Meski segala ilmu manusia akhirnya bertekuk lutut pada Pencipta Ilmu Segala Ilmu, kedua orangtuaku tak menyerah. Bahkan setelah ibu menjadi &#8216;tak sempurna&#8217; karena upayanya.Tahukah apa yang membuat Pencipta bisa Luluh pada hamba-Nya? Dengan segala usaha dan penyerahan diri sepenuhnya, akhirnya takdirku ke dunia dihantarkan oleh ribuan malaikat yang bersujud pada manusia-manusia yang sabar dan berupaya.Inilah kisahku.

<p>Summary : One of Vogue&#8217;s most anticipated books of 2023.A quintessentially American fashion narrative about the rise and fall of the first lifestyle brand, J.Crew, and what the company?s fate means for the shifting landscape of the retail industry.Once upon a time, a no-frills J.Crew rollneck sweater held an almost mystical power?or at least it felt that way. The story of J.Crew?is?the?story of the original ?lifestyle brand,? whose evolution charts a sea change in the way we dress, the way we shop, and who we aspire to be over the past four decades?all told through iconic clothes and the most riveting characters imaginable.In?The Kingdom of Prep,?seasoned fashion journalist Maggie Bullock tells J.Crew?s epic story for the first time, bringing to life the deliciously idiosyncratic people who built a beloved brand, unpacking the complex legacy of prep?a subculture born on the 1920s campuses of the Ivy League?and how one brand rose to epitomize ?American? style in two very different golden eras, </p>

<p>Summary : When you discover the world is a computer program, and you figure out that by altering the code you can time travel and perform acts that seem like magic, what can possibly go wrong?Pretty much everything.Just ask Brit, who has jumped around in time with such abandon that she has to coexist with multiple versions of herself. Now, Brit the Elder finds that her memories don&#8217;t match Brit the Younger&#8217;s. And there&#8217;s the small matter of a glitch that&#8217;s making Brit the Elder&#8217;s body fritz out. Brit the Elder&#8217;s ex-boyfriend Phillip wants to help her, but he&#8217;ll have to keep it secret from his current girlfriend, Brit the Younger, who can&#8217;t stand her future self.Meanwhile, Martin is trying to protect Phillip from a relentless attacker he somehow hasn&#8217;t noticed; Gwen is angry because Martin accidentally proposed to her; Gary tries to help the less fortunate, with predictably disastrous results; and an old nemesis might have to be the one to save them all.In Out of Spite, Out of Mind, our </p>

<p>Summary : A combination of dynastic disputes, feudal quibbles, trade disagreements and historical antagonism resulted in the opening of the Hundred Years War in 1337. The first major English land victory in this conflict was the Battle of Cr?cy (1346). This pitted the French army, then considered the best in Europe, against the English under King Edward III. The battle established the longbow as one of the most feared weapons of the medieval period, a reputation reinforced at the bloody Battle of Poitiers??????????????? (1356)?where much of the French nobility was slaughtered and their king captured by the English host.</p>

<p>Summary : A combination of dynastic disputes, feudal quibbles, trade disagreements and historical antagonism resulted in the opening of the Hundred Years War in 1337. The first major English land victory in this conflict was the Battle of Cr?cy (1346). This pitted the French army, then considered the best in Europe, against the English under King Edward III. The battle established the longbow as one of the most feared weapons of the medieval period, a reputation reinforced at the bloody Battle of Poitiers??????????????? (1356)?where much of the French nobility was slaughtered and their king captured by the English host.</p>

Now, it?s about survival.I?m in the heart of the Order, trying to solve a series of mysterious disappearances, while doing everything that I can not to become bait.Enemies are circling, and they can?t seem to decide if they see me as a pawn or as a threat. Oh, and there?s that little issue of being tethered to Rogan, who I now want to kill.It?s time to figure out just what I?m capable of though. Because fool me once&#8230;shame on you. But fool me twice&#8230;and I will crush your bones to dust.My name is Lennox Osseous, and I?m about to unleash the wrath of the Bone Witch.</p>

<p>Summary : In this essay, Orwell discusses the notion of nationalism, and argues that it causes people to disregard common sense and become more ignorant towards factuality. Orwell shows his concern for the social state of Europe, and in a broader sense, the entire world, due to an increasing amount of influence of nationalistic sentiment occurring throughout a large number of countries.</p>

<p>Summary : Il breve mandato di Juliette come comandante supremo del Nord America ? stato un completo disastro. Quando i figli degli altri leader mondiali si presentano alla sua porta, non desidera altro che rivolgersi a Warner come supporto e guida. Ma lui le spezza il cuore quando rivela di averle nascosto dei segreti sulla sua famiglia e sulla sua identit?, segreti che stravolgono ogni cosa. Juliette ? devastata e l&#8217;oscurit? che ha sempre albergato in lei minaccia di consumarla. Un incontro esplosivo con dei visitatori inaspettati potrebbe essere sufficiente per spingerla oltre il limite.</p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  An unflinching look at the challenges and misunderstandings mixed-race people face in family spaces and intimate relationships across their varying cultural backgrounds <br />
In this emotionally powerful and intellectually provocative blend of memoir, cultural criticism, and theory, scholar and essayist Samira Mehta reflects on many facets of being multiracial.Born to a white American and a South Asian immigrant, Mehta grew up feeling more comfortable with her mother?s family than with her father?s?they never carried on conversations in languages that she couldn?t understand or blamed her for finding the food was too spicy. But in adulthood, she realized that some of her Indian family?s assumptions about the world had become an indelible part of her.From this vantage point, Mehta tackles several topics in 7 essays around mixed-race identity:? Where Are You Really From? A Triptych? The Racism of People Who Love You? Failing the Authenticity Test? Meat Is Murder? Mentorship? Assimilation? </p>

  Amaryllis Fox&#8217;s riveting memoir tells the story of her ten years in the most elite clandestine ops unit of the CIA, hunting the world&#8217;s most dangerous terrorists in sixteen countries while fall in love and giving birth to a daughter. <br />

Her next assignment was at the Iraq desk in the Counterterrorism center. At 22, she was </p>

Twenty years in which she raised a family, protected her new citizens, and was completely cherished by the men who gave her their love. Raine should be happy.

She didn&#8217;t want to wear the mantle of responsibility and have control over the fates and lives of others. She wanted to bake cupcakes and have copious Big O&#8217;s. She wanted to stay in Dark River with her friends and her lovers, instead of jet setting all over the world, putting out political fires and rescuing creatures that stretched her very imagination.The Convocation said she could quit if she found someone strong enough to replace her, and there was only one creature that was on anyone&#8217;s lips; The Night Demon.Hiding in the shadow&#8217;s of Amsterdam, Raine and her guys were going to find him and put a crown on his head so they could finally start </p>

<p>Summary : The wedding day is just one day in the life of a couple. But God&#8217;s design is for marriage to last a lifetime. So how can someone know that the person they&#8217;re with is the one they can truly build a life with&#8211;especially when so few marriages around them work?Pastor Scott Kedersha has worked with more than 5,000 premarital couples to prepare them for the biggest decision of their lives. In Ready or Knot? he offers practical and Christ-centered guidance for couples for all of the days after the wedding day. Through authentic stories from real couples about the decisions they made (or wish they&#8217;d made), Scott asks the hard questions so his readers can break free from the watered-down Hollywood version of marriage and build their lives together on the right foundation&#8211;the unchanging Word of God.</p>

<p>Summary : The wedding day is just one day in the life of a couple. But God&#8217;s design is for marriage to last a lifetime. So how can someone know that the person they&#8217;re with is the one they can truly build a life with&#8211;especially when so few marriages around them work?Pastor Scott Kedersha has worked with more than 5,000 premarital couples to prepare them for the biggest decision of their lives. In Ready or Knot? he offers practical and Christ-centered guidance for couples for all of the days after the wedding day. Through authentic stories from real couples about the decisions they made (or wish they&#8217;d made), Scott asks the hard questions so his readers can break free from the watered-down Hollywood version of marriage and build their lives together on the right foundation&#8211;the unchanging Word of God.</p>

<p>Summary : The Tutor of History is an ambitious social saga, a compelling tale of idealism, love and alienation, set in contemporary Nepal caught between tradition and modernity. The events of the novel unfold against the backdrop of a campaign for parliamentary elections in the bustling roadside town of Khaireni Tar. At its heart the book is about four main characters: Giridhar Adhikari, the chairman of the People&#8217;s Party&#8217;s district committee, who suffers from a serious alcohol addiction and strange, violent manias; Rishi Parajuli, a lonely, under-employed bachelor and disillusioned communist who gives private tuitions in history to disinterested middle-class boys; Om Gurung, a former British Gurkha determined to bring love into every life in his hometown; and Binita Dahal, a reclusive young widow who runs a small tea shop and is careful not to demand of life more than the meagre pleasures it brings her. As the election campaign reaches its peak, the crisis in each character&#8217;s life mounts, and </p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;One of the best Game Theory books of all time&#8221; &#8211; BookAuthorityThis book provides many humorous anecdotes and insightful examples of how our daily lives are affected by Game Theory. Game Theory is the mathematical formalization of interactive decision-making &#8211; it assumes that each player&#8217;s goal is to maximize his/her benefit, whatever it may be. Players may be friends, foes, political parties, states, or any entity that behaves interactively, whether collectively or individually. One of the problems with game analysis is the fact that, as a player, it&#8217;s very hard to know what would benefit each of the other players; some of us are not even clear about our own goals or what might actually benefit us. Haim Shapira uses multiple examples to explain what Game Theory is and how the different interactions between decision-makers can play out. In this book you will: Meet the Nobel Laureate John F Nash and familiarize yourself with his celebrated equilibrium Learn the basic ideas of the art </p>

<p>Summary : From crude tools in the Stone Age to smartphones in the twenty-first century, technology has always had a pervasive role in human life. In this timely study, Anabel Quan-Haase examines the places where technology and society intersect, connecting the reality of our technological age to issues of social networks, communication, work, power, and inequality. The result is a broad yet efficient overview of the tools we use, where they come from, and how they are changing our perceptions of ourselves and the relationships we form with others.This fully revised second edition includes a new chapter on gender and technology, increased coverage of the history of technology, classical theories, and ethical considerations throughout.</p>

<p>Summary : A riveting, in-depth account of one of New York City?s most notorious crimes.On April 20, 1989, the body of a woman is discovered in Central Park, her skull so badly smashed that nearly 80 percent of her blood has spilled onto the ground. Within days, five black and Latino teenagers confess to her rape and beating. In a city where urban crime is at a high and violence is frequent, the ensuing media frenzy and hysterical public reaction is extraordinary. The young men are tried as adults and convicted of rape, despite the fact that the teens quickly recant their inconsistent and inaccurate confessions and that no DNA tests or eyewitness accounts tie any of them to the victim. They serve their complete sentences before another man, serial rapist Matias Reyes, confesses to the crime and is connected to it by DNA testing.Intertwining the stories of these five young men, the police officers, the district attorneys, the victim, and Matias Reyes, Sarah Burns unravels the forces that made </p>

<p>Summary : Hirsch?s rural beat is wide. Daybreak to day?s end, dirt roads and dust. Every problem that besets small towns and isolated properties, from unlicensed driving to arson. In the time of the virus, Hirsch is seeing stresses heightened and social divisions cracking wide open. His own tolerance under strain; people getting close to the edge.Today he?s driving an international visitor around: Janne Van Sant, whose backpacker son went missing while the borders were closed. They?re checking out his last photo site, his last employer. A feeling that the stories don?t quite add up.Then a call comes in: a roadside fire. Nothing much?a suitcase soaked in diesel and set alight. But two noteworthy facts emerge. Janne knows more than Hirsch about forensic evidence. And the body in the suitcase is not her son?s.</p>

<p>Summary : From the author of EXPECTING BETTER, an economist&#8217;s guide to the early years of parentingWith EXPECTING BETTER, award-winning economist Emily Oster spotted a need in the pregnancy market for advice that gave women the information they needed to make the best decision for their own pregnancies. By digging into the data, Oster found that much of the conventional pregnancy wisdom was wrong. In CRIBSHEET, she now tackles an even great challenge: decision making in the early years of parenting. As any new parent knows, there is an abundance of often-conflicting advice hurled at you from doctors, family, friends, and the internet. From the earliest days, parents get the message that they must make certain choices around feeding, sleep, and schedule or all will be lost. There&#8217;s a rule&#8211;or three&#8211;for everything. But the benefits of these choices can be overstated, and the tradeoffs can be profound. How do you make your own best decision?</p>

<p>Summary : From Edgar Award?winning novelist, playwright, and story-songwriter Rupert Holmes comes a diabolical thriller with a killer concept: The McMasters Conservatory for the Applied Arts, dedicated to the art of murder where students study how best to ?delete? their most deserving victim.Who hasn?t wondered for a split second what the world would be like if a person who is the object of your affliction ceased to exist? But then you?ve probably never heard of The McMasters Conservatory, dedicated to the consummate execution of the homicidal arts. To gain admission, a student must have an ethical reason for erasing someone who deeply deserves a fate no worse (nor better) than death. The campus of this ?Poison Ivy League? college?its location unknown to even those who study there?is where you might find yourself the practice target of a classmate?and where one?s mandatory graduation thesis is getting away with the perfect murder of someone whose death will make the world a much better place </p>

<p>Summary : A clear-eyed examination of the open access movement: past history, current conflicts, and future possibilities.Open access (OA) could one day put the sum of human knowledge at our fingertips. But the goal of allowing everyone to read everything faces fierce resistance. In Athena Unbound, Peter Baldwin offers an up-to-date look at the ideals and history behind OA, and unpacks the controversies that arise when the dream of limitless information slams into entrenched interests in favor of the status quo.

<p>Summary : A complete guide to cultivating and harvesting the beautiful opium poppy. The opium poppy is a potent plant that has been cultivated and used for thousands of years to alleviate suffering. The use of plant substances as alternatives to synthetic medicines is resurging due to their beneficial properties and less-toxic side effects. For example, many cancer and HIV sufferers are growing opium for personal use. Opium Poppy Garden is the only book available that describes the cultivation, harvest and pharmacology of opium in a format that combines literary and instructional writing. The heart of the book is the tale of Ch&#8217;ien, a young Chinese man who travels from Costa Rica to Columbia to grow an opium garden in the manner his Taoist grandfather taught him. The story, in conjunction with &#8220;The Cultivator&#8217;s Diary&#8221; and the technical appendix, provide the reader with a working knowledge of this plant.</p>

<p>Summary : A complete guide to cultivating and harvesting the beautiful opium poppy. The opium poppy is a potent plant that has been cultivated and used for thousands of years to alleviate suffering. The use of plant substances as alternatives to synthetic medicines is resurging due to their beneficial properties and less-toxic side effects. For example, many cancer and HIV sufferers are growing opium for personal use. Opium Poppy Garden is the only book available that describes the cultivation, harvest and pharmacology of opium in a format that combines literary and instructional writing. The heart of the book is the tale of Ch&#8217;ien, a young Chinese man who travels from Costa Rica to Columbia to grow an opium garden in the manner his Taoist grandfather taught him. The story, in conjunction with &#8220;The Cultivator&#8217;s Diary&#8221; and the technical appendix, provide the reader with a working knowledge of this plant.</p>

<p>Summary : * Duration: 14 hours and 39 minutes *Secrets and lies&#8230;I?ve lived the entirety of my life wrapped up in subterfuge for one purpose: revenge.Through the years, I lived more as an enigma than a man. For so long, I denied I had a beating heart of my own. Until her. Until she unearthed the starving vessel inside, forced me to acknowledge it, forced me to understand that I?m capable of bleeding the same as any other. For that, we paid. We&#8217;re still paying. Yet, she demands it still, the useless heart of the ruthless thief and shameless villain she fell for. My fear is, I?m no longer that man. With the lies I?ve told, the life I?ve led, my mistakes are beginning to catch up with me, day by day, one by one. This is my last chance, and I have no intention of losing her again, but as the deception of my past starts to unravel and close in, shedding my humanity may be the only thing that can save us both. Maybe it?s already too late.The Ravenhood trilogy is a gritty modern-day take on </p>

<p>Summary : A richly reported and provocative look at the history of women?s sports and the controversy surrounding trans athletes by a leading LGBTQ+ sports journalist.For decades women have been playing competitive sports thanks in large part to the protective cover of Title IX. Since passage of that law, the number of women participating in sports and the level of competition in high school, college, and professionally, has risen dramatically. In Fair Play, award-winning journalist Katie Barnes traces the evolution of women?s sports as a pastime and a political arena, where equality and fairness have been fought over for generations. As attitudes toward gender have shifted to embrace more fluidity in recent decades, sex continues to be viewed as a static binary that is easily determined: male or female. It is on that very idea of static sex that we have built an entire sporting apparatus. Now that foundation is crumbling as a result of intense culture wars. Whether we are talking about </p>

<p>Summary : A gripping novel about the whirlwind rise of an iconic 1970s rock group and their beautiful lead singer, revealing the mystery behind their infamous break up.Everyone knows Daisy Jones &amp; The Six, but nobody knows the real reason why they split at the absolute height of their popularity&#8230;until now.Daisy is a girl coming of age in L.A. in the late sixties, sneaking into clubs on the Sunset Strip, sleeping with rock stars, and dreaming of singing at the Whisky a Go-Go.

<p>Summary : <br />
  Most people didn&#8217;t make it to Cell Six, he said. Most called out the safe word ? reprieve ? after the first Cell. It was that intense. <br />
 When Bryan, Jaidee, Victor and Jane team up to compete at a full-contact escape room, it seems simple. Hold your nerve through six terrifying challenges; collect all the red envelopes; win a huge cash prize. But the real horror is unfolding outside of the game, in a series of deceits and misunderstandings fuelled by obsession and prejudice. And by the end of the night, one of the contestants will be dead. A startlingly soulful exploration of complicity and masquerade, Reprieve combines the psychological tension of classic horror with searing social criticism, and seamlessly threads together trial transcripts, evidence descriptions, and deeply layered individual narratives to present a chilling portrait of American life.</p>

<p>Summary : Conversations with Wilder, an invaluable, photo-intensive volume, is a kind of remake of Truffaut&#8217;s must-read interview book Hitchcock, with Cameron Crowe in the inquisitive Truffaut role and wily 93-year-old Billy Wilder as the crafty master director.

<p>Summary : Conversations with Wilder, an invaluable, photo-intensive volume, is a kind of remake of Truffaut&#8217;s must-read interview book Hitchcock, with Cameron Crowe in the inquisitive Truffaut role and wily 93-year-old Billy Wilder as the crafty master director. Drawing on his experience interviewing the monsters of rock and his deep, shot-by-shot knowledge of Wilder&#8217;s work, Crowe gently and cunningly coaxes answers from Wilder&#8211;arguably today&#8217;s most influential living director&#8211;on what made his hits tick and his flops suck, along with glimpses of what might have been.

<p>Summary : A call to action that pulls together all of Sir Ken Robinson?s key messages and philosophies, and that challenges and empowers readers to re-imagine our world, and our systems, for the better.Sir Ken Robinson changed the lives of millions of people.

<p>Summary : The first historical biography, for many decades, of Martin Luther (1483-1546), the rebellious monk who ushered in the modern world. When on October 31, 1517 an unknown monk nailed a theological pamphlet to the church door in a small university town, he set in motion a process that helped usher in the modern world. Within a few years Luther&#8217;s ideas had spread like wildfire. His attempts to reform Christianity by returning it to its biblical roots split the Western Church, divided Europe and polarised people&#8217;s beliefs, leading to religious persecution, social unrest and war; and in the long run his ideas would help break the grip of religion on every sphere of life. Yet Luther was a deeply flawed human being: a fervent believer tormented by spiritual doubts; a prolific writer whose translation of the Bible would shape the German language yet whose attacks on his opponents were vicious and foul-mouthed; a married ex-monk who liberated human sexuality from the stigma of sin but who </p>

<p>Summary : In a parched southern California of the near future, Luz, once the poster child for the country?s conservation movement, and Ray, an army deserter turned surfer, are squatting in a starlet?s abandoned mansion. Most ?Mojavs,? prevented by armed vigilantes from freely crossing borders to lusher regions, have allowed themselves to be evacuated to encampments in the east. Holdouts like Ray and Luz subsist on rationed cola and water, and whatever they can loot, scavenge, and improvise.For the moment, the couple?s fragile love, which somehow blooms in this arid place, seems enough. But when they cross paths with a mysterious child, the thirst for a better future begins. Immensely moving, profoundly disquieting, and mind-blowingly original, Watkins?s novel explores the myths we believe about others and tell about ourselves, the double-edged power of our most cherished relationships, and the shape of hope in a precarious future that may be our own.</p>

<p>Summary : Fifteen-year-old Nina Perez is faced with a future she never expected. She must leave her Garden of Eden, her lush home in the Dominican Republic, when she&#8217;s sent by her mother to seek out a better life with her brother in New York. As Nina searches for some glimpse of familiarity amid the jarring world of Washington Heights, she must uncover her own strength. She learns to uncover roots within foreign soil and finds a way to grow, just like the orchids that blossom on her fire escape. And when she is confronted by ugly secrets about her brother&#8217;s business, she comes to understand the realities of life in this new place. But then she meets him-that green-eyed boy- who she can&#8217;t erase from her thoughts, the one who just might help her learn to see beauty in spite of tragedy.From the acclaimed author of The Color of My Words comes a powerful story about a young girl who must make her way in a new world and find her place within it.</p>

<p>Summary : El mundo de ayer es uno de los m?s conmovedores y atractivos testimonios de nuestro pasado reciente, escrito adem?s con mano maestra por un europeo empapado de civilizaci?n y nostalgia por un mundo, el suyo, que se iba desintegrando a pasos agigantados. Escritor extraordinariamente popular y testigo de excepci?n de los cambios que convulsionaron la Europa del siglo XX entre las dos guerras mundiales, Zweig recuerda, despose?do y en tierra extra?a?en unas circunstancias personales de insospechado dramatismo?, los momentos fundamentales de su vida, paralela en mucho a la desmembraci?n de aquella Europa central que se quer?a m?s libre y segura, al abrigo de la locura y la tormenta. El resultado es un libro capital, uno de los mejores de Zweig y referencia inexcusable para entender los desvar?os de un siglo devastador.?El mundo de ayer es una lecci?n magistral sobre la demolici?n de los v?nculos entre palabra y verdad?.Rafael Argullol, El Pa?s</p>

<p>Summary : Breaking news: Hollywood?s biggest heartthrob, Ryan Prince, was caught vacationing in his hometown, but who?s the mystery girl?No, I hadn?t heard that Ryan Prince was staying at the very resort I had just started working at.If I had, maybe I would have called in sick.On second thought, maybe I wouldn?t have, because I really needed that paycheck. Being a single mother and having a lapse in child support had made me that desperate.Still, I would have rather avoided the circus that rolled into Hawk Tail Resort and the man who sauntered in with it.Tall with those perfectly rounded shoulders made for throwing footballs and winning championships, he carried himself in that regal way that told everyone in the room he was all talent and power.All these years later and he was still that same gorgeous man I left behind in college.Except now he wasn?t gracing the gridiron unless it was for a movie role.I assumed he wouldn?t even recognize me, not with the actress on his arm and the crowd </p>

And what can Stoicism teach us about how to live together?In the past few years, Stoicism has been making a comeback. But what exactly did the Stoics believe? In Lessons in Stoicism, philosopher John Sellars weaves together the key ideas of the three great Roman Stoics &#8211; Seneca, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius &#8211; with snapshots of their fascinating lives, to show us how their ideas can help us today.In vivid prose, Sellars shows how the works of these three Stoics have inspired readers ever since, speaking as they do to some of the perennial issues that face anyone trying to navigate their way through life.

<p>Summary : We?ve been led to believe that when we get sick, it?s our genetics. Or it?s just bad luck?and doctors alone hold the keys to optimal health. For years, Lissa Rankin, M.D., believed the same. But when her own health started to suffer, and she turned to Western medical treatments, she found that they not only failed to help; they made her worse. So she decided to take matters into her own hands.???? Through her research, Dr. Rankin discovered that the health care she had been taught to practice was missing something crucial: a recognition of the body?s innate ability to self-repair and an appreciation for how we can control these self-healing mechanisms with the power of the mind. In an attempt to better understand this phenomenon, she explored peer-reviewed medical literature and found evidence that the medical establishment had been proving that the body can heal itself for over 50 years.? ??

<p>Summary : During the war between the kingdoms of Volstov and Ke-Han, no fighter could match Rook for sheer arrogance and skill. Only Rook could ride the great dragon Havemercy, whose savagery and bloodlust matched his own. His brother, Thom, is bookish, diffident, and reserved, yet he yearns for Rook?s approval?and fears he can never earn it. With the war over, and an uneasy truce between the two nations, Thom hopes the long-lost brothers can bond on a trip together.But Rook cares only that Havemercy lies scattered in pieces across Ke-Han?and someone is buying up her parts, and those of other fallen dragons. The beasts are dead, but the magic that powered them is not. And now a Ke-Han agent, a Volstov sorceress, and a group of desert tribesmen are vying to possess that magic and control the future.</p>

<p>Summary : Even the perfect marriage has its dark side??Iris and Will&#8217;s marriage is as close to perfect as it can be: a large house in a nice Atlanta neighborhood, rewarding careers and the excitement of trying for their first baby. But on the morning Will leaves for a business trip to Orlando, Iris&#8217;s happy world comes to an abrupt halt. Another plane headed for Seattle has crashed into a field, killing everyone on board, and according to the airline, Will was one of the passengers on this plane.?Grief-stricken and confused, Iris is convinced it all must be a huge misunderstanding. But as time passes and there is still no sign of Will, she reluctantly accepts that he is gone. Still, Iris needs answers. Why did Will lie about where he was going? What is in Seattle? And what else has he lied about? As Iris sets off on a desperate quest to find out what her husband was keeping from her, the answers she receives will shock her to her very core.</p>

<p>Summary : For curious readers young and old, a rich and colorful history of religion from humanity?s earliest days to our own contentious timesIn an era of hardening religious attitudes and explosive religious violence, this book offers a welcome antidote. Richard Holloway retells the entire history of religion?from the dawn of religious belief to the twenty-first century?with deepest respect and a keen commitment to accuracy. Writing for those with faith and those without, and especially for young readers, he encourages curiosity and tolerance, accentuates nuance and mystery, and calmly restores a sense of the value of faith.

Holloway proves an </p>

<p>Summary : Shirdi Sai Baba (d.1918) is one of the most important latter day Indian saints. He lived an ascetic existence as a faqir in a rural mosque. He is distinctive for a universalist attitude, bypassing religious dogma. The teachings of Sai Baba employed allusion and parable, and are not typical of the traditions associated with him. Some complexities of this matter are addressed in a separate chapter.This book provides an assessment of Shirdi Sai Baba, taking into account both the Muslim Sufi and Hindu components of his biography. The author has integrated the available materials without neglecting some frequently overlooked details and supporting data. Many people look at Shirdi Sai Baba as a unifying force between Hindus and Muslims, while others see him as representing only one religious identity. This book covers these points in great detail.In eighty chapters, the sources are analysed to portray diverse events of the saint&#8217;s life, and to profile many of his devotees. Employing the </p>

<p>Summary : The West?s commitment to freedom, reason, and true liberalism has never been more seriously threatened than it is today by the stifling forces of political correctnessDr. Gad Saad, the host of the YouTube show THE SAAD TRUTH, exposes the bad ideas?what he calls ?idea pathogens??that are killing common sense and rational debate. Incubated in our universities and spread through the tyranny of political correctness, these ideas are endangering our most basic freedoms?including freedom of thought and speech.The danger is grave, but as Dr. Saad shows, politically correct dogma is riddled with logical fallacies. We have powerful weapons to fight back with?if we have the courage to use them.A provocative guide to defending reason and intellectual freedom and a battle cry for the preservation of our fundamental rights.</p>

<p>Summary : With It&#8217;s Not You, It&#8217;s What Happened to You: Complex Trauma and Treatment, Dr. Christine Courtois has simplified her extensive and, until now, quite scholarly work geared toward understanding and developing the concept of &#8220;complex trauma,&#8221; and the assessment and treatment thereof. A universally acknowledged leader in this emerging psychotherapeutic field, Dr. Courtois provides here an abbreviated and easy-to-read explanation of what complex trauma is, how it develops, the ways in which it manifests, and how it can effectively be dealt with. The book opens with an explanation of trauma in general-providing historical perspective, examining the various types of traumatic experience, and looking in-depth at the chronic, repetitive, and layered forms of trauma that often build upon and reinforce one another to create complex trauma. Next Dr. Courtois discusses trauma-driven emotional turmoil, and trauma&#8217;s effects on memory, self-image, relationships, and even physical wellbeing. She </p>

<p>Summary : Family can be complicated. Especially when skeletons from the past pop up unexpectedly. For American Evie Gray, finding out her deceased mother had a secret identity, and not one of the caped crusader variety, was quite the surprise. Evie?s mom had a secret life before she was even born, one that involved tiaras. In this modern day fairytale, Evie is on a path to figure out who her mom really was, while discovering for herself what the future will hold. Charged with her late mother?s letters, Evie embarks on a quest into her past. The first item on the list is to attend Oxford, her mom?s alma mater. There, Evie stumbles upon a real life prince charming, Edmund Stuart the second Prince of England, who is all too happy to be the counterpart to her damsel in distress. Evie can?t resist her growing attraction to Edmund as they spend more time together trying to unravel the clues her mother left behind. But, when doubts arise as to whether or not Edmund could ever be with an untitled </p>

<p>Summary : How many times has someone offered you that wonderfully insightful piece of advice to &#8216;just be yourself&#8217;? Like it hadn&#8217;t crossed your mind already? Here is a wee book with a big idea?that you should be nobody but yourself?offering inspiration and direction for everybody who wants to be more specifically somebody. At a time when we&#8217;re looking for a more honest approach to everything from food to music to politics, Never Not a Lovely Moon offers not a path to being yourself, but being yourself as the path. In her two decades of being a student and teacher of IDOLOGY, Caroline has worked all over the world with thousands of individuals, from celebrated artists to Fortune 500 CEOs to schoolchildren in India, using her unique perspective to shine a light on theirs. This just might be the operating manual you should have been born with.</p>

<p>Summary : After having travelled west for weeks, the party of pioneers comes to a crossroads. It is time for their leader, George Donner, to make a choice. They face two diverging paths which lead to the same destination. One is well-documented ? the other untested, but rumoured to be shorter.Donner?s decision will shape the lives of everyone travelling with him. The searing heat of the desert gives way to biting winds and a bitter cold that freezes the cattle where they stand. Driven to the brink of madness, the ill-fated group struggles to survive and minor disagreements turn into violent confrontations. Then the children begin to disappear. As the survivors turn against each other, a few begin to realise that the threat they face reaches beyond the fury of the natural elements, to something more primal and far more deadly.Based on the true story of the Donner Party, The Hunger is an eerie, shiver-inducing exploration of human nature, pushed to its breaking point.</p>

<p>Summary : Listening Length: 10 hours and 13 minutesMoving with my three best friends and our seven kids into a dilapidated brownstone in Boston may have seemed like the most insane thing I?d do this year. Apparently the universe said hold my beer. Because last night I got drunk and married my boss. Don?t worry, it?s all fake. Or at least everything after &#8216;I Do&#8217; will be. Beckett Langfield is grumpy, rich and hates kids. I?m an overworked, overstressed, and overweight single mom. The only reason we?re getting married is because he needs to fix a PR disaster and I am available. As in sitting next to him, in a bar, when he has this brilliant idea. Considering I just got divorced, I?m not looking to do that again. But Beckett makes me an offer that I literally can?t refuse, so I don?t. He?ll help fix up our broken house and all I have to do is take a few pictures and pretend we?re happily married. Easy peasy. Now if someone could just remind him that it?s all fake.

<p>Summary : Desde que la abandonaron de ni?a en una de las bibliotecas m?gicas de Austermeer, Elisabeth ha crecido entre grimorios que susurran en los estantes y que, ante la menor provocaci?n, se transforman en monstruos de tinta y cuero. All? espera terminar su aprendizaje para encargarse de custodiarlos y proteger a los dem?s de su poder. Cuando alguien sabotea la seguridad de la biblioteca para liberar el grimorio m?s peligroso que alberga, Elisabeth se ve implicada en el crimen y sin nadie a quien recurrir con la excepci?n de su enemigo jurado: el hechicero Nathaniel Espinosa, siempre acompa?ado de su misterioso sirviente. Ser? al ver que ante ella comienzan a desplegarse unas posibilidades que nunca podr?a haber imaginado cuando Elisabeth empiece a cuestionar todo lo que le han ense?ado sobre sus adoradas bibliotecas, sobre la hechicer?a e incluso sobre s? misma.</p>

Para penguasa sering merasa terganggu oleh sastrawan karena sering bersikap kritis pada pemerintah, politikus, dan pejabat korup.Apa peranan sastra bagi Indonesia? Siapakah tokoh-tokoh sastra Indonesia paling berpengaruh dalam satu abad perjalanan sastra Indonesia? Dalam hal apa dan dikalangan mana mereka berpengaruh? Dan sejauh mana jangkauan pengaruh mereka, baik secara sosial, politik, maupun budaya?Buku 33 Tokoh Sastra Indonesia Paling Berpengaruh ini menjawab pertanyaan-pertanyaan tersebut, sekaligus menunjukkan kalangan mana saja yang berperan dalam sastra dan kebudayaan. Buku ini menawarkan menu baru bagi perbincangan tentang tokoh-tokoh bangsa dari wilayah yang tidak selalu populer tapi menentukan tegak-tidaknya martabat suatu bangsa, yakni tradisi tulis dan kebudayaannya.</p>

<p>Summary : The Great Sutta on Good Fortune describes a thirty-eight step practice we can take to better our lives. Two and a half millennia ago the Buddha outlined a path of practice leading to freedom and happiness. While he mostly taught monastics, the lessons of this Sutta are aimed at the rest of us: describing steps each of us can take that lead towards wisdom. The poem is one of the first learned and memorized by school children in South Asia, but it is little known in the West. This book guides you through all thirty-eight steps with an eye to how to bring them into your life, while providing historical context. The book includes a foreword by eminent translator and scholar Bhikkhu Bodhi.</p>

<p>Summary : A timely and heartfelt collection of essays inspired by the #MeToo movement, edited by acclaimed young adult and middle-grade author Janet Gurtler. Featuring Beth Revis, Mackenzi Lee, Ellen Hopkins, Saundra Mitchell, Jennifer Brown, Cheryl Rainfield and many more.When #MeToo went viral, Janet Gurtler was among the millions of people who began to reflect on her past experiences. Things she had reluctantly accepted?male classmates groping her at recess, harassment at work?came back to her in startling clarity. She needed teens to know what she had not: that no young person should be subject to sexual assault, or made to feel unsafe, less than or degraded.You Too? was born out of that need. By turns thoughtful and explosive, these personal stories encompass a wide range of experiences and will resonate with every reader who has wondered, ?Why is this happening to me?? or secretly felt that their own mistreatment or abuse is somehow their fault?it?s not. Candid and empowering, You Too? </p>

<p>Summary : Ashish Patel didn?t know love could be so?sucky. After he?s dumped by his ex-girlfriend, his mojo goes AWOL. Even worse, his parents are annoyingly, smugly confident they could find him a better match. So, in a moment of weakness, Ash challenges them to set him up. The Patels insist that Ashish date an Indian-American girl?under contract. Per subclause 1(a), he?ll be taking his date on ?fun? excursions like visiting the Hindu temple and his eccentric Gita Auntie. Kill him now. How is this ever going to work? Sweetie Nair  is many things: a formidable track athlete who can outrun most people in California, a loyal friend, a shower-singing champion. Oh, and she?s also fat. To Sweetie?s traditional parents, this last detail is the kiss of death. Sweetie loves her parents, but she?s so tired of being told she?s lacking because she?s fat. She decides it?s time to kick off the Sassy Sweetie Project, where she?ll show the world (and herself) what she?s really made of. Ashish and Sweetie </p>

<p>Summary : Ashish Patel didn?t know love could be so?sucky. After he?s dumped by his ex-girlfriend, his mojo goes AWOL. Even worse, his parents are annoyingly, smugly confident they could find him a better match. So, in a moment of weakness, Ash challenges them to set him up. The Patels insist that Ashish date an Indian-American girl?under contract. Per subclause 1(a), he?ll be taking his date on ?fun? excursions like visiting the Hindu temple and his eccentric Gita Auntie. Kill him now. How is this ever going to work? Sweetie Nair  is many things: a formidable track athlete who can outrun most people in California, a loyal friend, a shower-singing champion. Oh, and she?s also fat. To Sweetie?s traditional parents, this last detail is the kiss of death. Sweetie loves her parents, but she?s so tired of being told she?s lacking because she?s fat. She decides it?s time to kick off the Sassy Sweetie Project, where she?ll show the world (and herself) what she?s really made of. Ashish and Sweetie </p>

<p>Summary : Percy Jackson is about to be kicked out of boarding school&#8230; again. And that&#8217;s the least of his troubles. Lately, mythological monsters and the gods of Mount Olympus seem to be walking straight out of the pages of Percy&#8217;s Greek mythology textbook and into his life. And worse, he&#8217;s angered a few of them. Zeus&#8217;s master lightning bolt has been stolen, and Percy is the prime suspect. Now Percy and his friends have just ten days to find and return Zeus&#8217;s stolen property and bring peace to a warring Mount Olympus. But to succeed on his quest, Percy will have to do more than catch the true thief: he must come to terms with the father who abandoned him; solve the riddle of the Oracle, which warns him of betrayal by a friend; and unravel a treachery more powerful than the gods themselves.</p>

<p>Summary : Von einem Tag auf den n?chsten ist nichts mehr so, wie es war. Der Monteur Josef Bloch, fr?her einmal ein bekannter Torwart, wird wortlos entlassen &#8211; jedenfalls ist er eines Morgens fest davon ?berzeugt. Er verl?sst seine Arbeitsstelle und spaziert ziellos durch Wien. Alles st?rt ihn: Die Ger?usche der Stadt sind zu laut, deren Grellheit irritiert ihn. Er fl?chtet sich in ein dunkles Kino. Mitten im Film h?rt her eine Gl?cke l?uten, doch er weiss nicht mehr, ob das Ger?usch zum Film geh?rt oder ob es vom nahegelegenen Naschmarkt ins Kino hereindringt. Es ist, als sei die Welt mit einem Mal aus den Fugen geraten. Doch das ist noch nicht alles: Schon bald geschieht ein Mord&#8230;</p>

<p>Summary : Von einem Tag auf den n?chsten ist nichts mehr so, wie es war. Der Monteur Josef Bloch, fr?her einmal ein bekannter Torwart, wird wortlos entlassen &#8211; jedenfalls ist er eines Morgens fest davon ?berzeugt. Er verl?sst seine Arbeitsstelle und spaziert ziellos durch Wien. Alles st?rt ihn: Die Ger?usche der Stadt sind zu laut, deren Grellheit irritiert ihn. Er fl?chtet sich in ein dunkles Kino. Mitten im Film h?rt her eine Gl?cke l?uten, doch er weiss nicht mehr, ob das Ger?usch zum Film geh?rt oder ob es vom nahegelegenen Naschmarkt ins Kino hereindringt. Es ist, als sei die Welt mit einem Mal aus den Fugen geraten. Doch das ist noch nicht alles: Schon bald geschieht ein Mord&#8230;</p>

<p>Summary : Black Swans is a collection of nine stories that look back on the 1980s and early 1990s?decades of dreams, drink, and stoned youth turning Republican. Babitz prowls California, telling tales of a changing world. She writes about the Rodeo Gardens, about AIDS, about learning to tango, about the Hollywood Cemetery, about the self-enchanted city, and, most important, about the envy and jealousy underneath it all. Babitz?s inimitable voice propels these stories forward, corralling everything that gets in their way: sex, rage, the Ch?teau Marmont, youth, beauty, Jim Morrison, men, women, and black swans. This exciting reissue further celebrates the phenomenon of Eve Babitz, cementing her reputation as the voice of a generation.</p>

<p>Summary : Black Swans is a collection of nine stories that look back on the 1980s and early 1990s?decades of dreams, drink, and stoned youth turning Republican. Babitz prowls California, telling tales of a changing world. She writes about the Rodeo Gardens, about AIDS, about learning to tango, about the Hollywood Cemetery, about the self-enchanted city, and, most important, about the envy and jealousy underneath it all. Babitz?s inimitable voice propels these stories forward, corralling everything that gets in their way: sex, rage, the Ch?teau Marmont, youth, beauty, Jim Morrison, men, women, and black swans. This exciting reissue further celebrates the phenomenon of Eve Babitz, cementing her reputation as the voice of a generation.</p>

She begins drinking heavily and stalking him: watching him at work, spying </p>

<p>Summary : It?s 1814. Napoleon has escaped his imprisonment on Elba. Europe is in shambles. Britain is at war on four fronts. And at Stranje House, a School for Unusual Girls, five young ladies are secretly being trained for a world of spies, diplomacy, and war.Tess Aubreyson can?t run far enough or fast enough to escape the prophetic dreams that haunt her. Dreams bring nothing but death and grief, and Tess refuses to accept that she may be destined for the same madness that destroyed her mother. Until her disturbing dreams become the only means of saving Lord Ravencross, the man she loves, and her fellow students at Stranje House. Tess?s old friend, the traitorous Lady Daneska, and Ghost, the ruthless leader of the Iron Crown, have returned to England, intent on paving the way for Napoleon?s invasion. Can the young ladies of Stranje House prevail once more? Or is England destined to fall into the hands of the power-mad dictator?</p>

<p>Summary : Teens fight for their humanity in this thrilling third book in the &#8220;New York Times&#8221; bestselling Unwind dystology by Neal Shusterman. Connor and Lev are on the run after the destruction of the Graveyard, the last safe haven for AWOL Unwinds. But for the first time, they&#8217;re not just running away from something. This time, they&#8217;re running towards answers, in the form of a woman Proactive Citizenry has tried to erase from history itself. If they can find her, and learn why the shadowy figures behind unwinding are so afraid of her, they may discover the key to bringing down unwinding forever. Cam, the rewound boy, is plotting to take down the organization that created him. He knows that if he can bring Proactive Citizenry to its knees, it will show Risa how he truly feels about her. And without Risa, Cam is having trouble remembering what it feels like to be human. With the Juvenile Authority and vindictive parts pirates hunting them, their paths will converge explosively&#8211;and everyone </p>

<p>Summary : Petroleum has always been used by humans: as an adhesive by Neanderthals, as a waterproofing agent in Noah&#8217;s Ark and as a weapon during the Crusades. Its eventual extraction from the earth in vast quantities transformed light, heat and power. A Pipeline Runs Through It is a fresh, comprehensive in-depth look at the social, economic, political and geopolitical forces involved in our transition to the modern oil age. It tells an extraordinary origin story, from the pre-industrial history of petroleum through to large-scale production in the mid-nineteenth century and the development of a dominant, fully-fledged oil industry by the early twentieth century. This was always a story of imperialist violence, political disenfranchisement, economic exploitation and environmental destruction. The near total eradication of the Native Americans of New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio has barely been mentioned as a precondition for the emergence of the first industrialised oil region in the United </p>

<p>Summary : The first book in R. Scott Bakker&#8217;s Prince of Nothing series creates a world from whole cloth-its language and classes of people, its cities, religions, mysteries, taboos, and rituals. It&#8217;s a world scarred by an apocalyptic past, evoking a time both two thousand years past and two thousand years into the future, as untold thousands gather for a crusade. Among them, two men and two women are ensnared by a mysterious traveler, Anas?rimbor Kellhus &#8211; part warrior, part philosopher, part sorcerous, charismatic presence &#8211; from lands long thought dead. The Darkness That Comes Before is a history of this great holy war, and like all histories, the survivors write its conclusion.</p>

<p>Summary : W?elk verhaal blijft er van je over als je er niet meer bent?Mattias liep de deur uit en kwam niet meer terug. En zij bleven achter. Acht mensen wier verhalen elkaar kruisen. Sommigen hadden hem lief, anderen kenden hem niet eens, maar allemaal worden ze gestuurd door de wendingen van een wereld in verwarring. Langzaam wordt duidelijk wie Mattias was en welk noodlot hem trof. En met welke spoken zijn achterblijvers worstelen.Na Mattias is een voetafdruk van een vroege dood. Aangrijpend, maar ook onverwachts hoopvol.</p>

<p>Summary : When a white servant girl violates the order of plantation society, she unleashes a tragedy that exposes the worst and best in the people she has come to call her family. Orphaned while onboard ship from Ireland, seven-year-old Lavinia arrives on the steps of a tobacco plantation where she is to live and work with the slaves of the kitchen house. Under the care of Belle, the master&#8217;s illegitimate daughter, Lavinia becomes deeply bonded to her adopted family, though she is set apart from them by her white skin. Eventually, Lavinia is accepted into the world of the big house, where the master is absent and the mistress battles opium addiction. Lavinia finds herself perilously straddling two very different worlds. When she is forced to make a choice, loyalties are brought into question, dangerous truths are laid bare, and lives are put at risk.</p>

<p>Summary : Tatum Harding.Resident pilot.A man of surprises.Self-proclaimed voyeur.At the monthly dinner with the Brotherhood, he reveals his gift?a trip to Los Angeles, where I?m scheduled to debut as a designer at the Fashion Festival. To sweeten the deal, he allows me a plus-one.Sebastian is my only choice, but there?s just one condition.Tatum wants to watch.The idea should disturb me, and when he makes it clear he wants to join, I definitely shouldn?t agree.Because grave decisions come with consequences, and this one is a doozy, spawning so much guilt that I compound the mistake with an even bigger one.A single moment of distrust turns my world upside down, ending in trauma and tragedy.I?ve survived a lifetime?s worth of suffering at the hands of these men, but this?This will be the catalyst that destroys me.Part 9 of The Zodiac Queen. Intended for mature readers who enjoy dark and explicit themes. Reader discretion is advised.</p>

To sweeten the deal, he allows me a plus-one.Sebastian is my only choice, but there?s just one condition.Tatum wants to watch.The idea should disturb me, and when he makes it clear he wants to join, I definitely shouldn?t agree.Because grave decisions come with consequences, and this one is a doozy, spawning so much guilt that I compound the mistake with an even bigger one.A single moment of distrust turns my world upside down, ending in trauma and tragedy.I?ve survived a lifetime?s worth of suffering at the hands of these men, but this?This will be the catalyst that destroys me.Part 9 of The Zodiac Queen.

<p>Summary : George Orwell?s 1945 satire on the perils of Stalinism has proved magnificently long-lived as a parable about totalitarianism anywhere?and has given the world at least one immortal phrase: ?Everyone is equal, but some are more equal than others.?This new dramatization sticks very closely to the book, and the production has toured all over England, Scotland, Wales and Romania in Orwell?s centenary year. ?Dare I say it . . . as good as the book.??Guardian</p>

<p>Summary : This is Alabaster Penitentiary?where they send you when the world thinks you?re dead. And trust me, you?ll wish you were. We?re the stain on society. The freaks, the creeps, your favorite Netflix documentaries come to life. They lock us up and throw away the key, because we deserve it. But not me. I?m just a lowly bank robber. I don?t belong here, surrounded by psychopaths and killers with no remorse? At least, I don?t think I do. Getting by unscathed is my top priority. Unfortunately for me and my fellow prisoners, those in charge are more dangerous than we are. You see, the guards run the show, and I seem to have caught the attention of the most twisted one. He has a name, but it might as well be Officer. We move around one another like a sun and a moon, revolving in an axis of confused lust and torment until the truth is distorted, and the thing I once feared becomes that which I crave; my vile addiction, somehow so exquisite. Reality warps in the dungeon, and I?m left wondering </p>

<p>Summary : A score of centuries has passed since the First Apocalypse and the thoughts of men have turned, inevitably, to more worldly concerns&#8230;A veteran sorcerer and spy seeks news of an ancient enemy. A military genius plots to conquer the known world for his Emperor but dreams of the throne for himself. The spiritual leader of the Thousand Temples seeks a Holy War to cleanse the land of the infidel. An exiled barbarian chieftain seeks vengeance against the man who disgraced him. And into this world steps a man like no other, seeking to bind all &#8211; man and woman, emperor and slave &#8211; to his own mysterious ends.But the fate of men &#8211; even great men &#8211; means little when the world itself may soon be torn asunder. Behind the politics, beneath the religious fervour, a dark and ancient evil is reawakening. After two thousand years, the No-God is returning. The Second Apocalypse is nigh. And one cannot raise walls against what has been forgotten&#8230;</p>
