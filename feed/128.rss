<p>Summary : Time is running out, and the fate of reality itself lies in Micah&#8217;s hands.Micah fought the Third Prince of Elsewhere once. He was defeated more thoroughly than he had ever thought possible. Even when he fled from his failure through time itself, the Prince pursued him, dogged and unwilling to give up on an injured quarry.The gods gave him a quest: gather the artifacts needed so that he could contend with an evil capable of devouring existence itself. He fought and bled, finally acquiring the tools he thought he would need for the climactic battle waiting for him when he returned home. Unfortunately, his adventures didn&#8217;t prepare him for one simple truth.He was not ready.The Third Prince was more powerful than any human that had ever lived and ever would live. Fighting a being older and more sinister than myth and legend itself was a fool&#8217;s errand, but when fate called, sometimes there weren&#8217;t heroes and demigods waiting in the wings to defeat it. Sometimes, there was only a fool left </p>

<p>Summary : In the Blink of an Eye is celebrated film editor Walter Murch&#8217;s vivid, multifaceted, thought &#8212; provoking essay on film editing. Starting with what might be the most basic editing question &#8212; Why do cuts work? &#8212; Murch treats the reader to a wonderful ride through the aesthetics and practical concerns of cutting film. Along the way, he offers his unique insights on such subjects as continuity and discontinuity in editing, dreaming, and reality; criteria for a good cut; the blink of the eye as an emotional cue; digital editing; and much more. In this second edition, Murch reconsiders and completely revises his popular first edition&#8217;s lengthy meditation on digital editing (which accounts for a third of the book&#8217;s pages) in light of the technological changes that have taken place in the six years since its publication.</p>

<p>Summary : In the Blink of an Eye is celebrated film editor Walter Murch&#8217;s vivid, multifaceted, thought &#8212; provoking essay on film editing. Starting with what might be the most basic editing question &#8212; Why do cuts work? &#8212; Murch treats the reader to a wonderful ride through the aesthetics and practical concerns of cutting film. Along the way, he offers his unique insights on such subjects as continuity and discontinuity in editing, dreaming, and reality; criteria for a good cut; the blink of the eye as an emotional cue; digital editing; and much more. In this second edition, Murch reconsiders and completely revises his popular first edition&#8217;s lengthy meditation on digital editing (which accounts for a third of the book&#8217;s pages) in light of the technological changes that have taken place in the six years since its publication.</p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  When raven shifter Riley Porter was given sanctuary by the Phoenix Pack, she let them believe she had left her flock. Reluctant to divulge the secrets of her past, she was still embraced as family. Only Tao Lukas, the protective and passionate Head Enforcer of the pack, was resistant to the enigmatic shifter. Until Riley started to arouse in him something other than suspicion&#8230; <br />
  Tao doesn?t trust lone shifters, especially ones so guarded &#8211; and tempting. But the sexual tension between them is making them both come undone, and vulnerable to more than desire. All Tao wants is for Riley to stay with him and to trust him with the truth of her past&#8230; <br />
  As Riley?s mysteries come to light, so does a danger that threatens not only her life but the safety of the entire pack. For Tao, keeping Riley safe means keeping her close &#8211; forever &#8211; as his mate!</p>

<p>Summary : No era capaz de amar. No hasta que conoc? a Cora. Mi ?ngel.He reclamado cada cent?metro de su cuerpo y quiero m?s.Soy un hombre que anhela el control, pero su poder sobre m? es absoluto.Ella guarda mi coraz?n en sus manos.Ella nunca puede saberlo.Los demonios de esta ciudad quieren destruirla.Es mi trabajo proteger su inocencia. Encerrarla a salvo en mi alta torre.Pero yo soy el peligro del que ella est? tratando de escapar.El despiadado hombre en su cama.Un demonio peor que todos los dem?s.Uno que no puede salvarla de s? mismo.</p>

<p>Summary : My name is Flint, but everyone in middle school calls me Squint because I?m losing my vision. I used to play football, but not anymore. I haven?t had a friend in a long time. Thankfully, real friends can see the real you, even when you can?t clearly see. Flint loves to draw. In fact, he?s furiously trying to finish his comic book so he can be the youngest winner of the ?Find a Comic Star? contest. He?s also rushing to finish because he has keratoconus?an eye disease that could eventually make him blind. McKell is the new girl at school and immediately hangs with the popular kids. Except McKell?s not a fan of the way her friends treat this boy named?Squint. He seems nice and really talented. He draws awesome pictures of superheroes. McKell wants to get to know him, but is it worth the risk? What if her friends catch her hanging with the kid who squints all the time? McKell has a hidden talent of her own but doesn?t share it for fear of being judged. Her terminally ill brother, Danny, </p>

<p>Summary : I was nothing but a road to Midas. A means to get to where he wanted to go, and I paved that path in gold.My life as been made up of gilded lies. But death has been shaped from rot.Like a phoenix caught fire, I will need to rise from the ashes and learn to wield my own power. Because my wings may have been clipped, but I am not in a cage, and I&#8217;m finally free to fly from the frozen kingdoms I&#8217;ve been kept in.Yet the world doesn&#8217;t want to let me.That&#8217;s the thing when you turn against a king-everyone else turns against you.Good thing I have a different king in my corner.But even with the dark threat of Slade Ravinger, the other monarchs are coming for me.So I will fight for him and he will kill for me, and if we need to become the villains, then so be it.Because so long as I live in this world, I won&#8217;t be used again.</p>

Those in favor of welcoming more immigrants often cite humanitarian reasons, while those in favor of more restrictive laws argue the need to protect native citizens.But economist Bryan Caplan adds a new, compelling perspective to the immigration debate: He argues that opening all borders could eliminate absolute poverty worldwide and usher in a booming worldwide economy?greatly benefiting humanity.With a clear and conversational tone, exhaustive research, and vibrant illustrations by Zach Weinersmith, Open Borders makes the case for unrestricted immigration easy to follow and hard to deny.</p>

<p>Summary : The remarkable progress in algorithms for machine and deep learning have opened the doors to new opportunities, and some dark possibilities. However, a bright future awaits those who build on their working methods by including HCAI strategies of design and testing. As many technology companies and thought leaders have argued, the goal is not to replace people, but to empower them by making design choices that give humans control over technology.In Human-Centered AI , Professor Ben Shneiderman offers an optimistic realist&#8217;s guide to how artificial intelligence can be used to augment and enhance humans&#8217; lives. This project bridges the gap between ethical considerations and practical realities to offer a road map for successful, reliable systems. Digital cameras, communications services, and navigation apps are just the beginning. Shneiderman shows how future applications will support health and wellness, improve education, accelerate business, and connect people in reliable, safe, and </p>

<p>Summary : Marsha Forchuk Skrypuch (author of Making Bombs for Hitler) crafts a story of ultimate compassion and sacrifice based on true events during WWII.The year is 1941. Krystia lives in a small Ukrainian village under the cruel &#8212; sometimes violent &#8212; occupation of the Soviets. So when the Nazis march into town to liberate them, many of Krystia&#8217;s neighbors welcome the troops with celebrations, hoping for a better life.But conditions don&#8217;t improve as expected. Krystia&#8217;s friend Dolik and the other Jewish people in town warn that their new occupiers may only bring darker days.The worst begins to happen when the Nazis blame the Jews for murders they didn&#8217;t commit. As the Nazis force Jews into a ghetto, Krystia does what she can to help Dolik and his family. But what they really need is a place to hide. Faced with unimaginable tyranny and cruelty, will Krystia risk everything to protect her friends and neighbors?</p>

<p>Summary : ?Ahora una serie de Netflix que se emitir? el 29 de diciembre de 2021!Un robo a un banco con toma de rehenes. Una escalera llena de polic?as a punto de asaltar un apartamento. Llegar a esto fue sorprendentemente f?cil. S?lo hizo falta una mala idea. Una idea mala de verdad.Visitar un apartamento en venta no es una situaci?n de vida o muerte. A menos que sea la v?spera de Nochevieja, vivas en una peque?a ciudad en Suecia y alguien haya tenido la peor idea de su vida y decidido atracar un banco que no maneja efectivo. Entonces, s? lo es. Porque, cuando alguien es as? de idiota, es inevitable que no sepa c?mo huir y termine en un apartamento en venta tomando rehenes sin querer.Pero puedes confiar en la polic?a. A menos que los dos agentes encargados del caso no se entiendan entre ellos y tengan cero experiencia con tomas de rehenes. Entonces, no.Aunque todo ir? bien si los rehenes mantienen la calma. A menos que sean los peores rehenes de la historia: una millonaria suicida, una anciana </p>

Una escalera llena de polic?as a punto de asaltar un apartamento. Llegar a esto fue sorprendentemente f?cil. S?lo hizo falta una mala idea. Una idea mala de verdad.Visitar un apartamento en venta no es una situaci?n de vida o muerte. A menos que sea la v?spera de Nochevieja, vivas en una peque?a ciudad en Suecia y alguien haya tenido la peor idea de su vida y decidido atracar un banco que no maneja efectivo. Entonces, s? lo es. Porque, cuando alguien es as? de idiota, es inevitable que no sepa c?mo huir y termine en un apartamento en venta tomando rehenes sin querer.Pero puedes confiar en la polic?a. A menos que los dos agentes encargados del caso no se entiendan entre ellos y tengan cero experiencia con tomas de rehenes. Entonces, no.Aunque todo ir? bien si los rehenes mantienen la calma.

In a world where meaning has become twisted into a form of currency that everyone is very keen to cash in on, journalist Wendy Syfret invites you to change the way you think about the way you think.In her seminal work, The Sunny Nihilist, Syfret presents the optimism in Nihilism, encouraging us to dismantle our self-care and self-centered way of living and accept a life more or less ordinary. Syfret re-examines the meaning of worth, value, time, happiness, success, and connection, and guides us towards the alternative path of pointless pleasure.When you let go of the idea that everything must have purpose, you will find relief from stress, exhaustion, and anxiety. Most importantly, you can embrace the opportunity to enjoy the moment, the present, the chaos and luck of being alive at all. The </p>

<p>Summary : Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning are now mainstream business tools. They are being applied across many industries to increase profits, reduce costs, save lives and improve customer experiences. Consequently, organizations which understand these tools and know how to use them are benefiting at the expense of their rivals.Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for Business cuts through the hype and technical jargon that is often associated with these subjects. It delivers a simple and concise introduction for managers and business people. The focus is very much on practical application and how to work with technical specialists (data scientists) to maximize the benefits of these technologies.The third edition has been substantially revised and updated. It contains several new chapters and covers a broader set of topics than before, but retains the no-nonsense style of the original.</p>

<p>Summary : This book offers a critical analysis of the European colonial heritage in the Arab countries and highlights the way its legacy is still with us today, informing the current state of relations between Europe and the formerly colonized states.The work analyses the fraught relationship between the Western powers and the Arab countries that have been subject to their colonial rule. It does so by looking at this relationship from two vantage points. On the one hand is that of humanitarian intervention&#8211;a paradigm under which colonial rule coexisted alongside humanitarian policies pursued on the dual assumption that the colonized were barbarous peoples who wanted to be civilized and that the West could lay a claim of superiority over an inferior humanity. On the other hand is the Arab view, from which the humanitarian paradigm does not hold up, and which accordingly offers its own insights into the processes through which the Arab countries have sought to wrest themselves from colonial </p>

<p>Summary : In una terra fuori dal mondo, dove le estati e gli inverni possono durare intere generazioni, sta per esplodere un immane conflitto. Sul Trono di Spade, nel Sud caldo e opulento, siede Robert Baratheon. L&#8217;ha conquistato dopo una guerra sanguinosa, togliendolo all&#8217;ultimo, folle re della dinastia Targaryen, i signori dei draghi. Ma il suo potere ? ora minacciato: all&#8217;estremo Nord, la Barriera ? una muraglia eretta per difendere il regno da animali primordiali e, soprattutto, dagli Estranei ? sembra vacillare. Si dice che gli Estranei siano scomparsi da secoli. Ma se ? vero, chi sono allora quegli esseri con gli occhi cos? azzurri e gelidi, nascosti tra le ombre delle foreste, che rubano la vita, o il senno, a chi ha la mala sorte di incontrarli? La fine della lunga estate ? vicina, l&#8217;inverno sta arrivando: solo un nuovo prodigio potr? squarciare le tenebre.

<p>Summary : A fallen angel with a broken heart. The Horseman who rejected him. A love that can destroy them both.Punished for choosing love over faith, the Archangel of Kindness emerged from a century of confinement enshrined in darkness, a shell of his former self.

But soon a </p>

<p>Summary : Los mapas, ricos en sorpresas y posibilidades, tienen el poder de transportarnos. En este volumen, escritores e ilustradores de talla mundial comparten sus visiones personales.

Mapas literarios, un fascinante viaje visual y verbal, resultar? irresistible para los amantes de los mapas y para todo aquel que disfruta </p>

<p>Summary : Seventeen-year-old Erich is a prisoner of war working at a northern Alberta logging camp. Twelve-year-old Max goes to school &#8212; reluctantly &#8212; in the nearby town. The two would be unlikely friends, except that neither has anyone else to turn to. At the height of World War II, nobody wants to befriend a German.It doesn&#8217;t matter that Erich was forced into the military by his father, or that Max was proudly born in Canada. They are both easy targets for the locals&#8217; grief and anger against the Nazis. The other prisoners are no more welcoming, distrustful of Erich&#8217;s perfect English and his dislike for Nazism. Still, when a series of accidents shakes the logging camp, they pressure Erich to question the Canadians and find the saboteur &#8212; even if his questions get him into trouble. Caught between angry prisoners and suspicious captors, Erich is afraid to take any action at all. It is only when Max&#8217;s schoolyard tormentors cross a dangerous line that Erich realizes that his real loyalties lie </p>

<p>Summary : Kim White is a very popular cheerleader. She?s pretty, healthy, and comes from a well-off family. She has everything a girl of sixteen is supposed to want. And she?s sick to death of it. In search of something to pull her out of suicidal thoughts, she decides to lose her virginity, having heard it?s a life-changing event. But Kim doesn?t want to do it the same way the other girls do. She seduces one of her teachers, hoping to ruin his life just for the fun of it. This starts Kim on a runaway train of sadism as she makes every effort to destroy the lives of those around her. But soon simple backstabbing is not enough to keep her excited, and she nosedives into sabotage, violence and even murder. When Kim finds out she?s pregnant with her teacher?s child, a new madness overtakes her, and she realizes there?s only one thing that will satisfy her baby?s hunger . . .</p>

<p>Summary : <br />
  A life for a life ? will kill the both of us in the end.Clover <br />
I know nothing of the Sickness at Eastpoint University. I know only the backroads that slip past the southern beaches and the gators that make their way onto the swamps shores. Until him. Until the killer known as Braxton Smalls finds his way into my stilted trailer on the coast of Port Charlotte.He came looking for Ace, but he found me instead? <br />

<p>Summary : Fed up with teenage life in the suburbs, Jaimal Yogis ran off to Hawaii with little more than a copy of Hermann Hesse&#8217;s Siddhartha and enough cash for a surfboard. His journey is a coming-of-age saga that takes him from communes to monasteries, from the warm Pacific to the icy New York shore. Equal parts spiritual memoir and surfer&#8217;s tale, this is a chronicle of finding meditative focus in the barrel of a wave and eternal truth in the great salty blue.</p>

<p>Summary : A beautiful, stunningly ambitious tale of endurance, identity, and memory, for fans of Min Jin Lee&#8217;s Pachinko and Georgia Hunter&#8217;s We Were the Lucky Ones.Singapore, 1942. As Japanese troops sweep down Malaysia and into Singapore, a village is ransacked. Only three survivors remain, one of them a tiny child.In a neighbouring village, seventeen-year-old Wang Di is bundled into the back of a troop carrier and shipped off to a Japanese military rape camp. In the year 2000, her mind is still haunted by her experiences there, but she has long been silent about her memories of that time. It takes twelve-year-old Kevin, and the mumbled confession he overhears from his ailing grandmother, to set in motion a journey into the unknown to discover the truth.Weaving together two timelines and two life-changing secrets, How We Disappeared is an evocative, profoundly moving and utterly dazzling novel heralding the arrival of a new literary star.</p>

<p>Summary : Based on author Sebastian Mallaby&#8217;s unprecedented access to the industry, including three hundred hours of interviews, More Money Than God tells the inside story of hedge funds, from their origins in the 1960s and 1970s to their role in the financial crisis of 2007-2009. Wealthy, powerful, and potentially dangerous, hedge fund moguls have become the It Boys of twenty-first ?century capitalism. Ken Griffin of Citadel started out trading convertible bonds from his dorm room at Harvard. Julian Robertson staffed his hedge fund with college athletes half his age, then he flew them to various retreats in the Rockies and raced them up the mountains. Paul Tudor Jones posed for a magazine photograph next to a killer shark and happily declared that a 1929-style crash would be &#8220;total rock-and-roll&#8221; for him. Michael Steinhardt was capable of reducing underlings to sobs. &#8220;All I want to do is kill myself,&#8221; one said. &#8220;Can I watch?&#8221; Steinhardt responded. Finance professors have long argued that </p>

<p>Summary : For eleven years, Oakley Farrell has been silent. At the age of five, she stopped talking, and no one seems to know why. Refusing to communicate beyond a few physical actions, Oakley remains in her own little world. Bullied at school, she has just one friend, Cole Benson. Cole stands by her, refusing to believe that she is not perfect the way she is. Over the years, they have developed their own version of a normal friendship. However, will it still work as they start to grow even closer? When Oakley is forced to face someone from her past, can she hold her secret in any longer?</p>

<p>Summary : A masterful intellectual portrait, Goethe: Life as a Work of Art is celebrated as the seminal twenty-first-century biography of the writer considered to be the Shakespeare of German literature. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749?1832), a remarkably prolific poet, playwright, novelist, and?as R?diger Safranksi emphasizes?a statesman and naturalist, first awakened not only a burgeoning German nation but the European continent with his electrifying novel The Sorrows of Young Werther. Safranski has scoured Goethe?s entire oeuvre, relying exclusively on primary sources, including his correspondence with contemporaries, to produce a ?fresh and authentic? (Economist) portrait of the avatar of the Romantic era. Skillfully blending ?artistic analysis with swift, sharp renderings? of the great political and intellectual figures Goethe encountered, ?[Safranski?s] portrait of the prolific genius leaves the reader with lasting awe, even envy? of a monumental legacy (The New Yorker).

<p>Summary : En las p?ginas de este libro excepcional se entretejen dos hilos: por un lado, el rescate de la historia del abuelo materno del autor a partir de un viaje de este para dar una conferencia en la ciudad de Lviv, que fue polaca y actualmente forma parte de Ucrania. Por el otro, la peripecia de dos abogados jud?os y un acusado alem?n en el juicio de N?remberg, cuyas vidas tambi?n confluyen en esa ciudad invadida por los nazis. Los dos jud?os estudiaron all? y salvaron sus vidas porque emigraron a tiempo ?uno a Inglaterra, el otro a Estados Unidos?, y el acusado ?tambi?n brillante abogado y asesor jur?dico de Hitler? fue gobernador durante la ocupaci?n. Y as?, a partir de las sutiles conexiones entre estos cuatro personajes ?el abuelo, los dos abogados jud?os que participan en N?remberg, uno con el equipo de juristas brit?nico y el otro con el americano, y el nazi, un hombre culto que acab? abrazando la barbarie?, emerge el pasado, la Sho?, la Historia con may?sculas y las peque?as </p>

<p>Summary : A mother?s love knows no bounds?London, 1754. Six years after leaving her newborn, Clara, at London?s Foundling Hospital, young Bess Bright returns to reclaim the illegitimate daughter she has never really known. Dreading the worst?that Clara has died in care?the last thing she expects to hear is that her daughter has already been reclaimed. Her life is turned upside down as she tries to find out who has taken her little girl?and why.Less than a mile from Bess?s lodgings in a quiet town house, a wealthy widow barely ventures outside. When her close friend?an ambitious doctor at the Foundling Hospital?persuades her to hire a nursemaid for her young daughter, she is hesitant to welcome someone new into her home and her life. But her past is threatening to catch up with her?and will soon tear her carefully constructed world apart.Set against the vibrant backdrop of Georgian London, The Lost Orphan explores families and secrets, class and power, and how the pull of motherhood cuts across </p>

<p>Summary : Seventeen-year-old Cassie is a natural at reading people. Piecing together the tiniest details, she can tell you who you are and what you want. But it?s not a skill that she?s ever taken seriously. That is, until the FBI come knocking: they?ve begun a classified program that uses exceptional teenagers to crack infamous cold cases, and they need Cassie.What Cassie doesn?t realize is that there?s more at risk than a few unsolved homicides?especially when she?s sent to live with a group of teens whose gifts are as unusual as her own. Sarcastic, privileged Michael has a knack for reading emotions, which he uses to get inside Cassie?s head?and under her skin. Brooding Dean shares Cassie?s gift for profiling, but keeps her at arm?s length.Soon, it becomes clear that no one in the Naturals program is what they seem. And when a new killer strikes, danger looms closer than Cassie could ever have imagined. Caught in a lethal game of cat and mouse with a killer, the Naturals are going to have </p>

Voler vendere un lotto di terra ricevuto in eredit?. &#8220;La terra ? affare dell&#8217;uomo, non della donna.&#8221; Siamo in Nebraska nel 1922. Tess scrive gialli &#8220;rassicuranti&#8221;, popolati da vecchiette che giocano ai detective. Una sera, viene aggredita e stuprata da un misterioso &#8220;gigante&#8221;. Creduta morta e lasciata in un canale di scolo, sopravvive e medita vendetta. Streeter, bancario malato di cancro, incontra il Diavolo nelle fattezze di un venditore ambulante. L&#8217;affare che conclude decide la sorte del suo migliore amico, colpevole di avergli rubato la ragazza tanti anni prima.

<p>Summary : Un agricoltore uccide la moglie e la getta in un pozzo. La sua colpa? Voler vendere un lotto di terra ricevuto in eredit?. &#8220;La terra ? affare dell&#8217;uomo, non della donna.&#8221; Siamo in Nebraska nel 1922. Tess scrive gialli &#8220;rassicuranti&#8221;, popolati da vecchiette che giocano ai detective. Una sera, viene aggredita e stuprata da un misterioso &#8220;gigante&#8221;. Creduta morta e lasciata in un canale di scolo, sopravvive e medita vendetta. Streeter, bancario malato di cancro, incontra il Diavolo nelle fattezze di un venditore ambulante. L&#8217;affare che conclude decide la sorte del suo migliore amico, colpevole di avergli rubato la ragazza tanti anni prima. Due anni dopo le nozze d&#8217;argento, Darcy scopre che suo marito custodisce in garage un segreto. Un fiume di pazzia scorre sotto il prato fiorito del loro matrimonio. Che fare? Tirare avanti come prima o cercare una via d&#8217;uscita? I quattro nerissimi romanzi brevi raccolti in questo libro parlano di donne uccise, seviziate o comunque &#8220;rimesse al loro </p>

<p>Summary : Leo ? un sedicenne come tanti: ama le chiacchiere con gli amici, il calcetto, il suo iPod. Le ore passate a scuola sono uno strazio, ma il nuovo supplente di storia e filosofia ? diverso: una luce gli brilla negli occhi quando spiega, quando sprona gli studenti a vivere intensamente, a cercare il proprio sogno. Leo sente in s? la forza di un leone, ma c&#8217;? un nemico che lo atterrisce: il bianco. Il rosso invece ? il colore dell&#8217;amore, della passione, del sangue; rosso ? il colore dei capelli di Beatrice. Perch? un sogno Leo ce l&#8217;ha e si chiama Beatrice, anche se lei ancora non lo sa. Quando scopre che Beatrice ? ammalata e che la malattia ha a che fare con quel bianco che tanto lo spaventa, Leo dovr? scavare a fondo dentro di s?, sanguinare e rinascere, per capire che i sogni non possono morire e trovare il coraggio di credere in qualcosa di pi? grande.</p>

<p>Summary : A brilliantly conceived, deeply unsettling psychological thriller? already an international sensation?about a woman haunted by secrets, the consuming desire for revenge, and the terrible price we pay when we try to hide the truth.Finding a mysterious novel at her bedside plunges documentary filmmaker Catherine Ravenscroft into a living nightmare. Though ostensibly fiction, The Perfect Stranger recreates in vivid, unmistakable detail the terrible day she became hostage to a dark secret, a secret that only one other person knew?and that person is dead.Now that the past is catching up with her, Catherine?s world is falling apart. Her only hope is to confront what really happened on that awful day . . . even if the shocking truth might destroy her.</p>

<p>Summary : She is beautiful, she is a princess, and Aphrodite is her favorite goddess, but something in Helen of Sparta just itches for more out of life. Not one to count on the gods?or her looks?to take care of her, Helen sets out to get what she wants with steely determination and a sassy attitude. That same attitude makes Helen a few enemies?such as the self-proclaimed &#8220;son of Zeus&#8221; Theseus?but it also intrigues, charms, and amuses those who become her friends, from the famed huntress Atalanta to the young priestess who is the Oracle of Delphi.In Nobody&#8217;s Princess, author Esther Friesner deftly weaves together history and myth as she takes a new look at the girl who will become Helen of Troy. The resulting story offers up adventure, humor, and a fresh and engaging heroine you cannot help but root for.</p>

That same attitude makes Helen a few enemies?such as the self-proclaimed &amp;#8220;son of Zeus&amp;#8221; Theseus?but it also intrigues, charms, and amuses those who become her friends, from the famed huntress Atalanta to the young priestess who is the Oracle of Delphi.In Nobody&amp;#8217;s Princess, author Esther Friesner deftly weaves together history and myth as she takes a new look at the girl who will become Helen of Troy. The resulting story offers up adventure, humor, and a fresh and engaging heroine you cannot help but root for.

<p>Summary : Want to kill my sister? You?ll have to go through me first. I will stop you. Even if it means I have to go back to the palace. Even if it means I have to take back the crown I left behind. Even if it means I have to face the four men I left at the altar. I will take on them and their anger. I will take on anything to save Avia. Because the kingdom needs her. The kingdom needs a good queen. Not a cursed one. Not me. If I can?t save her, then the kingdom will fall. Because I can?t rule.  I?m a walking death sentence for anyone who gets too close?</p>

  This book must not be ignored. It really is our final warning. <br />
Mark Lynas delivers a vital account of the future of our earth, and our civilisation, if current rates of global warming persist. And it?s only looking worse.We are living in a climate emergency.

Degree by terrifying degree, he charts the likely consequences of global heating and the ensuing climate catastrophe. ?At one degree ? the world we are already living in ? vast wildfires scorch California and Australia, while monster hurricanes devastate coastal cities. At two degrees the Arctic ice cap melts away, and coral reefs disappear from the tropics. At three, the world begins to run out of food, threatening millions with </p>

<p>Summary : From the creator of Mama Natural?the web?s #1 most popular pregnancy blog and YouTube channel for natural living?comes the first ever week-to-week pregnancy book for expectant moms who want to embrace natural pregnancy and an empowering natural childbirth.For the last half-century, control over childbirth has been in favor of doctors.

<p>Summary : Mexican Gothic meets Outlander in this spellbinding, atmospheric timeslip debut novel, as a woman struggling with her mental health spends the winter with her cruel in-laws in their eerie, haunting manor that sweeps her back through time and into the arms of her fianc?&#8217;s mysterious, alluring 19th century ancestor.Traveling to be with her fianc?s terminally ill mother in her last days, Saoirse Read expected her introduction to the family?s ancestral home would be bittersweet. But the stark thrust of Langdon Hall against the cliff and the hundred darkened windows in its battered walls are almost as forbidding as the woman who lies wasting inside. Her fianc?s parents make no secret of their distaste for Saoirse, and their feelings have long since spread to their son. Or perhaps it is only the shadows of her mind suggesting she?s unwelcome, seizing on her fears while her beloved grieves?As Saoirse takes to wandering the estate?s winding, dreamlike gardens, overgrown and half-wild with </p>

<p>Summary : Uncommon Grounds tells the story of coffee from its discovery on a hill in ancient Abyssinia to the advent of Starbucks. In this updated edition of the classic work, Mark Pendergrast reviews the dramatic changes in coffee culture over the past decade, from the disastrous ?Coffee Crisis? that caused global prices to plummet to the rise of the Fair Trade movement and the ?third-wave? of quality-obsessed coffee connoisseurs. As the scope of coffee culture continues to expand, Uncommon Grounds remains more than ever a brilliantly entertaining guide to the currents of one of the world?s favorite beverages.</p>

<p>Summary : Ali has been hiding in an attic since civilization collapsed eight weeks ago.  When the plague hit, her neighbors turned into mindless, hungry, homicidal maniacs. Daniel has been a loner his entire life. Then the world empties and he realizes that being alone isn&#8217;t all it&#8217;s cracked up to be. Finn is a former cop who is desperate for companionship, and willing to do anything it takes to protect the survivors around him. When the three cross paths they band together; sparks fly, romance blooms in the wasteland and Ali, Daniel and Finn bend to their very human needs in the ruins of civilization. Lust, love and trust all come under fire in Flesh as the three battle to survive, hunted through the suburban wastelands.</p>

<p>Summary : In The Mirror of Mindfulness, seventeenth-century master Tsele Natsok Rangdr?l teaches that there is an identical essence intrinsic to the heart, mind, and spirit in every human being. The realization of this essential oneness in humanity, he said, makes any man or woman a Buddha. The book focuses on how to reach this understanding through a system of training of timeless, universal value that has been developed in Tibet.

<p>Summary : The 2016 presidential campaign of Donald Trump unleashed a wave of populism not seen in America since the Nixon era, which carried him into the presidency. Seen widely as a vindication of the people over elites, his failure to bring about any meaningful change was then seen as an aberration, a departure from a natural state where the people are sovereign and their representatives govern by their consent. This is the populist delusion.This book explodes that delusion. Beginning with the Italian elite school, Parvini shows the top-down and elite driven nature of politics by explicating one thinker per chapter: Mosca, Pareto, Michels, Schmitt, Jouvenel, Burnham, Francis, and Gottfried. The sobering picture that emerges is that the interests of the people have only ever been advanced by a tightly organized minority. Just as fire drives out fire, so an elite is only ever driven out by another elite.The Populist Delusion is the remedy for a self-defeating folk politics that has done the </p>

<p>Summary : An Indigenous environmental scientist breaks down why western conservationism isn?t working?and offers Indigenous models informed by case studies, personal stories, and family histories that center the voices of Latin American women and land protectors.Despite the undeniable fact that Indigenous communities are among the most affected by climate devastation, Indigenous science is nowhere to be found in mainstream environmental policy or discourse. And while holistic land, water, and forest management practices born from millennia of Indigenous knowledge systems have much to teach all of us, Indigenous science has long been ignored, otherized, or perceived as ?soft??the product of a systematic, centuries-long campaign of racism, colonialism, extractive capitalism, and delegitimization.Here, Jessica Hernandez?Maya Ch?orti? and Zapotec environmental scientist and founder of environmental agency Pi?a Soul?introduces and contextualizes Indigenous environmental knowledge and proposes a </p>

And while holistic land, water, and forest management practices born from millennia of Indigenous knowledge systems have much to teach all of us, Indigenous science has long been ignored, otherized, or perceived as ?soft??the product of a systematic, centuries-long campaign of racism, colonialism, extractive capitalism, and delegitimization.Here, Jessica Hernandez?Maya Ch?orti? and Zapotec environmental scientist and founder of environmental agency Pi?a Soul?introduces and contextualizes Indigenous environmental knowledge and proposes a Discover the Bestseller Everyone is Talking About: Read Fresh Banana Leaves: Healing Indigenous Landscapes Through Indigenous Science PDF , Reading Fresh Banana Leaves: Healing Indigenous Landscapes Through Indigenous Science pdf , Fresh Banana Leaves: Healing Indigenous Landscapes Through Indigenous Science Handbook , Fresh Banana Leaves: Healing Indigenous Landscapes Through Indigenous Science read , Fresh Banana Leaves: Healing Indigenous Landscapes Through Indigenous Science epub , Fresh Banana Leaves: Healing Indigenous Landscapes Through Indigenous Science in English , Fresh Banana Leaves: Healing Indigenous Landscapes Through Indigenous Science Kindle , Fresh Banana Leaves: Healing Indigenous Landscapes Through Indigenous Science audiobook Fresh Banana Leaves: Healing Indigenous Landscapes Through Indigenous Science Summary.

<p>Summary : This sociological study and true-crime expose tells of the rootless young Vietnamese males sent out of the country by their families as the Saigon regime was collapsing and, after months or years in refugee camps, placed with foster families in the U.S. Some of these youths became the nucleus of New York City&#8217;s Chinatown Born to Kill gang and were as violent as their name suggests. They made money &#8220;protecting&#8221; merchants and through holdups and invasions of homes, and their victims were always other Asians. One of their number, Tinh Ngo, was repelled by the gang&#8217;s bloodthirstiness and became a police informant. Thanks to him and to city and federal officers, seven of the gang were apprehended, tried in 1992 and given long prison sentences, the leader, David Thai, getting life. English, who previously authored The Westies, an account of Manhattan&#8217;s Hell&#8217;s Kitchen Irish, has hit the bulls-eye again. Photos not seen by PW.

<p>Summary : &#8220;Vous rirez, pleurerez, et votre entre-jambe se mettra ? chanter quand vous aurez rencontr? ce quarterback cochon, Saint Stevenson, le Flingueur !&#8221;C&#8217;est l&#8217;athl?te ultime. Je suis la personne la plus s?rieuse du monde. ?a n&#8217;a aucun sens de nous mettre ensemble, jusqu&#8217;? ce qu&#8217;on se retrouve dans le m?me lit&#8230;Je d?teste le sport, et c&#8217;est une star du football am?ricain. J&#8217;aime les hommes doux et pr?visibles, mais c&#8217;est une b?te de style et d&#8217;?rotisme. Saint Stevenson ne m&#8217;avait pas fait particuli?rement d&#8217;effet lors de notre premi?re rencontre, mais son cerveau tordu a vu ?a comme une ouverture.J&#8217;ai un plan de vie pour les cinq prochaine ann?es, pour moi et ma carri?re, mais ce quarterback de renom, arrogant, ?go?ste que l&#8217;on m&#8217;a confi? au boulot va tout g?cher.C&#8217;est un joueur parfait, sur le terrain et en dehors, et il n&#8217;y a aucune raison pour laquelle je devrais m&#8217;?prendre d&#8217;un sportif arrogant comme ?a ; mais il semblerait que notre amour n&#8217;ait aucun sens de toute fa?on.</p>

<p>Summary : In this first volume of his memoirs, Dr Kissinger covers his first four years (1969-1973) as Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs &#8211; and President Nixon&#8217;s closest adviser on foreign policy. It is undoubtedly the most significant book to come out of the Nixon Administration. Among the countless great and critical moments Dr Kissinger recalls are his first meeting with Nixon, his secret trip to China, the first SALT negotiation, the Jordan crisis of 1970, the India-Pakistan war of 1971, and the historic summit meetings in Peking and Moscow. He covers the major controversies over Indochina policy during that period, including events in Laos, the overthrow of Cambodia&#8217;s Prince Sihanouk, his secret talks with the North Vietnamese in Paris, his &#8216;Peace is at hand&#8217; press conference, and the breakdown of the talks that led to the &#8216;Christmas bombing&#8217; of 1972. He offers his insight s into the Middle East conflicts, Sadat&#8217;s break with the Soviets, the election of Salvador </p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;Hut! Hut! Go long, Tiki!&#8221;  Tiki and Ronde&#8217;s twelfth summer is winding down &#8212; the nights are getting shorter and the evenings cooler. That means two things: The first day of junior high is just a few days away, and it&#8217;s almost the start of football season at last. With two championships and an 8-2 season last year, Tiki and Ronde are ready to graduate from the Peewee League and hit the field as starting players for the Hidden Valley Eagles.  But junior high is a lot bigger than elementary school. The competition for starting spots is stiff, and seniority rules. If Tiki and Ronde make it past tryouts and cuts, will they get the chance to play, or will they have to spend the season watching from the bench with the other seventh graders?  Inspired by the childhood of NFL superstars Tiki and Ronde Barber, Kickoff! is a story of teamwork, perseverance, and what it takes to be a champion.</p>

He helped me believe in the power of unconditional love.Then, he was gone. When love is lost, and there?s no hope left, how do you go on?**This is not a romance novel, nor is it a sweet story about love. It is a tragedy and includes themes that may be triggering to some readers. Love Lost Her Way is recommended for ages 18 and over.**Trystan&#8217;s story, My Name is Tryst, is available now!</p>

<p>Summary : It is Friday evening before Labor Day weekend. Americans are hitting the highways in droves; the radio crackles with warnings of traffic jams and crashed cars. Steve Hogan and his wife, Nancy, have a long drive ahead?from New York City to Maine, where their children are in camp. But Steve wants a drink before they go, and on the road he wants another. Soon, exploding with suppressed fury, he is heading into that dark place in himself he calls ?the tunnel.? When Steve stops for yet another drink, Nancy has had enough. She leaves the car. On a bender now, Steve makes a friend: Sid Halligan, an escapee from Sing Sing. Steve tells Sid all about Nancy. Most men are scared, Steve thinks, but not Sid. The next day, Steve wakes up on the side of the road. His car has a flat, his money is gone, and there?s one more thing still left for him to learn about Nancy, Sid Halligan, and himself.</p>

<p>Summary : ?Christian?Rule Number 1: You ride in my truck; you let me open the door.Another problem was the last thing I needed. Unfortunately, Cassandra Parker was mine.But the biggest problem of all? It wasn?t the beautiful stranger sticking her nose in my operations. It wasn?t the bulldozer she was driving over my way of life. And it definitely wasn?t the fact that she was living in my house.My biggest problem? The engagement ring on her finger.?Cassandra?Rule Number 1: If you?re going to kill someone, make it look like an accident, cry at the funeral, admit to nothing, and deny everything.To be clear, I didn?t want to be Christian Griffith?s problem. But there I was: exiled from New York, stranded on a cattle ranch, and desperate to salvage what was left of my career.Living with a single dad and his children was a downgrade from my high-rise office and city comforts, but I agreed to it for one simple reason: to save my job.A hot cowboy wasn?t going to lasso me into staying a second longer </p>

<p>Summary : Du hast um die L?gen gebettelt, wie du jetzt um die Wahrheit bettelst. Und einem Betteln k?nnen wir einfach nicht widerstehen ?Mables erstes Studienjahr neigt sich dem Ende zu, aber es sind nicht ihre Pr?fungen, die sie herausfordern.

Nicht wegen der Dinge, die wir getan haben. Sondern wegen der Dinge, die wir tun werden. Lektion 5: Die schlimmsten Verbrecher in diesem Land sind Teil der Elite.Das ist die bittere Wahrheit, die du erfahren musst, Belle. Glitzer, Glitzer, kleine Prinzessin.

<p>Summary : I swear I?m a good girl. I didn?t go to the exclusive, after-hours masquerade to kiss my dad?s best friend. I didn?t even know who the masked man was when he touched me like I was his every fantasy. But when I learn exactly how off-limits my new lover is, I do my best to avoid him the next time. Except, he has his sinful sights set on me, even when he discovers who I am. Just one time , he whispers. Then we?ll pretend this never happened. Seems the enigmatic, gorgeous single dad I?ve known by day is a very dirty man after dark. But one night turns into a stolen weekend away, giving me a taste of so much more. When we return to the city, we vow to stay apart. We could never work . He?s focused on raising his young son, and I can?t let my already damaged family break more. But the caring, possessive man keeps coming back to me, and these secret nights tangled up together are turning into tender moments that make my heart thunder. And soon, this tease of a forbidden romance is making me </p>

<p>Summary : The final book in the series: Psychos In love. I&#8217;ve been na?ve, and that&#8217;s a cold pill to swallow. If you had asked me just a month ago, I would have told you that betrayal wasn&#8217;t possible anywhere near me. Boy, was I wrong. It&#8217;s been a hard lesson to learn that the person I thought was once my protector is now my enemy, and the ones I thought were my enemies are protecting me. It&#8217;s all really fucked up. Although I want to believe I&#8217;ve found it in this messed-up trio of men, but have I? I&#8217;m out for blood and not just the three of them, but my once protector. They will all pay before I let them make me bow again. I want to give in to them and let them have their way, but first, I have to show them I am not someone they can walk all over. They will kneel before me as the queen that I am.</p>

<p>Summary : She?s funny, sweet, and she has a smile that lights up every room. I?m A tall, ripped ex-soldier? and I?m supposed to be her best friend.My new hobby? I like to imagine how it could be more but I know that the relationship is all in my head. I can?t risk what we have for something intangible? I fantasize about her day and night. She?s a walking, talking fantasy? and she?s only a hair?s breadth away. But one wrong move could take what I value most. And once she looks my way for just a second, I don?t know how I could possibly let her go&#8230;</p>

<p>Summary : This is a book about expedition, adventure, our thirst for knowledge and pushing the limits of human endurance.From the navigational instruments that have led us through unknown lands, to the advanced engineering that carried us into the depths of the ocean, to the rocket science that propelled us into space, science and adventure have always been inextricably linked. Both are at the heart of everything we now know about the complex universe we find ourselves in.From the groundbreaking sea voyage in 1735 that settled the debate raging between Descartes and Newton about the shape of the earth to the balloon ride that led to the discovery of cosmic rays, we have pushed the limits of what?s possible, both on our planet and beyond the clouds.The Little Book of Big Explorations is a collection of some of the most daring and eye-opening adventures in history that have changed the way we view the world, as well as a look at what?s still to be discovered.

<p>Summary : JAXON KADE I can?t breathe? I don?t want to. With every breath that fills my lungs, I feel the pain she?s fighting and it?s killing me slowly, reminding me of the day she got ripped away.  I?ve gone thirteen years without her, and as if she was never gone, she walks back into my life, feisty as h@ll and set on running from me.  I refuse to let that happen.  She?s my Lex. It doesn?t matter if I have to destroy everything in my path that leads to her?I will.  I?ve been in love with her since the age of nine. I lost her once, and you better d@mn well believe that I will walk through the fires of Hell before losing her again.  She?s broken?  Ripped apart by the world. I?m making it my mission to piece her back together again and claim her as mine.  Every part of her sexy body has been possessed by me.  I know she sees she?s not the only one who has changed with time. I?m rough, savage, and just as damaged as she is.  But there?s one thing I?m capable of?always have been?and that is </p>

<p>Summary : Stalingrad snipers were legends in their time. Their patience, keen eyes, and ruthlessness helped win the Battle of Stalingrad and turn the tide of the Second World War. James Riordan visited Stalingrad in 1959 and several times later. In 2006 he met Tania Chernova, whose story was so fascinating that Riordan made her the heroine of this compelling novel. The year is 1942. Legendary sniper Vasily Zaitsev, who killed a record 242 Nazis, recruits Tania to seek out and shoot German officers. At first, she finds it almost impossible to kill. But when she discovers that her beloved grandparents, along with many of her friends, have been brutally murdered by invading Nazis, she vows to ?break them like sticks.? Following her capture and daredevil escape, she leads a handpicked unit on what seems like a suicide mission ? to seize Field Marshall Paulus, the Commander-in-Chief of the invading army. But Tania is no ordinary marksman. Author Riordan?s dramatic narrative and wealth of period </p>

<p>Summary : In the life of a top coach like Jos? Mourinho there is only one possible target in their profession: win. To achieve this, the Portuguese coach knows that it is absolutely essential to form a real group. How does he do to build teams, to lead them to transcendence, to motivate them after big wins, to manage egos so big towards the same objectives? The answer to these and other questions are in this book. The book features the exclusive participation of Jos? Mourinho, some major players led by him as Didier Drogba, Deco, V?tor Ba?a and Jorge Costa, and Rui Faria, his most important assistant for many years. Originally published in Portugal (already reached the 15th edition), it was No. 1 in the national top sales for three weeks.</p>

<p>Summary : In the life of a top coach like Jos? Mourinho there is only one possible target in their profession: win. To achieve this, the Portuguese coach knows that it is absolutely essential to form a real group. How does he do to build teams, to lead them to transcendence, to motivate them after big wins, to manage egos so big towards the same objectives? The answer to these and other questions are in this book. The book features the exclusive participation of Jos? Mourinho, some major players led by him as Didier Drogba, Deco, V?tor Ba?a and Jorge Costa, and Rui Faria, his most important assistant for many years. Originally published in Portugal (already reached the 15th edition), it was No. 1 in the national top sales for three weeks.</p>

Unerschrocken treten sie eine Reise ins Unbekannte an, hinunter in das unterirdische Labyrinth, das st?ndig seine Form ver?ndert. Und hinter jeder Biegung lauern neue Gefahren &#8230;</p>

<p>Summary : Inside the outrageous, come-from-behind story of Elon Musk and Tesla&#8217;s bid to build the perfect carElon Musk is among the most controversial titans of Silicon Valley. To some he&#8217;s a genius and a visionary; to others he&#8217;s a mercurial con artist. Billions of dollars have been gained and lost on his tweets; his personal exploits are the stuff of tabloids. But for all his outrageous talk of mind-uploading and space travel, his most audacious vision is the one closest to the ground: the electric car.When Tesla was founded in the mid 2000s, electric cars were novelties, trotted out and thrown on the scrapheap by carmakers for more than a century.

So they pitted themselves against the biggest, fiercest business rivals in the world, setting out to make a car that was faster, sexier, smoother, </p>

<p>Summary : Once upon a time he set me free. This time it won&#8217;t be that simple.I can&#8217;t stop wondering why the cartel heir with mafia blood in his cold veins saved me all those weeks ago. The young virginal misfit who was kidnapped and gifted to a villainous kingpin.But he did.And I was wrong to think he was my hero.I never expected to meet Tom?s Souza again. Or that I&#8217;d be covered in his father&#8217;s blood. However, fate has brought me face to face with a vengeful monster who&#8217;s blinded by wrath.Now, I&#8217;m his captive while he claims a merciless throne?and my innocence.Except he underestimates me. They all do.No matter the bond we share, our agreement must end, especially when the newly crowned king has a heart-shattering secret.Author Note: Hostile Heir is a duet within the Hostile Kingdom World. There is a HEA in the second book, Hostile King. It&#8217;s a forced proximity dark romance that includes scenarios and references which may act as a trigger to some readers.</p>

<p>Summary : Junto con las ideas de Friederich Nietzsche y Sigmund Freud, las propuestas sociales de Karl Marx (1818-1883) y Friedrich Engels (1820-1895) a menudo han sido consideradas como el tercer gran foco intelectual del siglo XIX. El manifiesto comunista, obra cumbre de estos dos ?ltimos autores, no solo constituye un grito en defensa del proletariado, sino que a su vez ofrece al lector una nueva manera de comprender los acontecimientos hist?ricos en los que el hombre se ha visto envuelto desde la noche de los tiempos. La historia de las sociedades se ver? definida por el concepto de ?lucha de clases?, por la cual una sociedad tendr? una transformaci?n revolucionaria o por el contrario traer? la ruina com?n de las clases en lucha.</p>

El manifiesto comunista, obra cumbre de estos dos ?ltimos autores, no solo constituye un grito en defensa del proletariado, sino que a su vez ofrece al lector una nueva manera de comprender los acontecimientos hist?ricos en los que el hombre se ha visto envuelto desde la noche de los tiempos.

<p>Summary : Emotions run high when the Sweet Magnolias try to reunite a couple who was meant to be together in this classic from #1 New York Times bestselling author Sherryl Woods When an eating disorder threatens the life of chef Dana Sue Sullivan&#8217;s teenage daughter, she has no choice but to bring Annie&#8217;s cheating dad back to Serenity, South Carolina. She tells herself and her friends it&#8217;s all about Annie, but the sad truth is she has a boatload of unresolved feelings of her own for Ronnie Sullivan. From the moment Ronnie hits town, there&#8217;s no question about his intentions. He&#8217;s there for his daughter, to be sure, but he wants Dana Sue back, and every move he makes is designed to prove he&#8217;s a changed man. The one thing that&#8217;s never changed, though, are the sparks that fly whenever the two of them are in the same room. Dana Sue can deny all she wants that Ronnie&#8217;s the only man for her, but not a single person in town is buying it. No matter the circumstances, Ronnie&#8217;s return is a sweet recipe </p>

<p>Summary : Life in the swamp can&#8217;t get any better for Liona and Beck. That&#8217;s until Beck pops a big question that forces Liona to face some unfinished business. She heads back to LA but Beck isn&#8217;t too far behind, this time looking less like an ogre thanks to some help from Winston the Wizard. Will magic be enough for Beck to get Liona to stay in his swamp forever? The bestselling ogre love story continues here? ?Beck and Liona are back and spicier than ever (if that?s even possible).&#8221; &#8211; Goodreads Review Amazon Please note that in order for the characters and events of this book to make sense, you must read the first book, Get In My An Ogre Love Story.</p>

<p>Summary : A comprehensive philosophy of contemporary life and politics, by one of the sharpest critics of the present We live in an age of impotence. Stuck between global war and global finance, between identity and capital, we seem to be incapable of producing the radical change that is so desperately needed. Is there still a way to disentangle ourselves from a global order that shapes our politics as well as our imagination? In his most systematic book to date, renowned Italian theorist Franco Berardi tackles this question through a solid yet visionary analysis of the three fundamental concepts of Possibility, Potency, and Power. Characterizing Possibility as the content, Potency as the energy, and Power as the form, Berardi suggests that the road to emancipation unravels from the awareness that the field of the possible is only limited, and not created, by the power structures that implement it. Other futures and other worlds are always already inscribed within the present, despite power&#8217;s </p>

Taking as his starting point dramatic examples such as the High Line in New York City and the outrageous island experiment of Dubai, Moore then reaches far </p>

<p>Summary : In General Naval Tactics, Naval War College professor and renowned tactical expert Milan Vego describes and explains those aspects of naval tactics most closely related to the human factor. Specifically, he explains in some detail the objectives and methods/elements of tactical employment of naval forces, command and control, combat support, tactical design, decision-making and planning/execution, leadership, doctrine, and training. Vego derives certain commonalities of naval tactics that occurred in recent and distant wars at sea. Many parts of his theoretical constructs are based on works of a number of well-known and influential naval theoreticians such as Admirals Alfred T. Mahan, Bradley A. Fiske, Raoul Castex, and Ren?

<p>Summary : Physical Biology of the Cell is a textbook appropriate for a first course in physical biology or biophysics for either undergraduate or graduate students. It maps the huge and complex field of cell and molecular biology from the distinct perspective of physical biology.By organizing ideas and data based on proximity in physical biology space we can study topics that are not obviously related in cell biology space. This organizational principle is the central thesis of the book: the appropriate application of a relatively small number of fundamental physical models can serve as the foundation of whole bodies of quantitative biological intuition, broadly useful across a wide range of biological problems.The much-anticipated full-color Second Edition includes new features and resources and is available in a variety of e-book formats.</p>
