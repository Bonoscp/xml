<p>Summary : Easy Digital Negatives is another remarkable book by Peter Mrhar, this time taking the reader step-by-step through the entire process of creating digital negatives that are the basis for almost all modern so-called alternative photographic techniques. Of course, the author again justifies his popularity with additional descriptions of how to reproduce images, with a description of his new technique for making negatives, with a description of the simplified procedure for calibrating the screen, and particularly describing a free program which automatically completes everything.In this book, of course, the reader first learns the basics of digital photography, which are necessary for making digital negatives. Then the settings of Adobe Photoshop and printers, and methods to increase and decrease print density are described, so that each reader can print the optimum negative, regardless of the price range of the printer.

<p>Summary : Too many companies think creativity means throwing money into marketing efforts and giving lip service to &#8220;out of the box&#8221; thinking. But such efforts rarely have a positive impact on the bottom line. Pat Fallon and Fred Senn argue that leaders have more creativity within their organizations than they realize&#8211;but they inadvertently stifle it or channel it in ineffective ways.

Drawing from 25 years of successful marketing and acclaimed, award-winning work, the authors show that bankable, creative ideas come from zeroing in on the one key business problem that must be solved and then rigorously unearthing insights that will lead to a spectacular solution. Behind-the-scenes stories of successful and failed campaigns for companies in diverse industries reveal the core secrets of training for </p>

<p>Summary : Discover the remarkable story of an orphaned Black boy who grew up to become the groundbreaking architect to the stars, Paul R. Williams. A stunning nonfiction picture-book biography from the Caldecott Honor-winning author and NAACP Image Award-nominated artist.As an orphaned Black boy growing up in America in the early 1900s, Paul R. Williams became obsessed by the concept of home. He not only dreamed of building his own home, he turned his dreams into drawings. Defying the odds and breaking down the wall of racism, Williams was able to curve around the obstacles in his way to become a world-renowned architect. He designed homes for the biggest celebrities of the day, such as Frank Sinatra and Lucille Ball, and created a number of buildings in Los Angeles that are now considered landmarks.From Andrea J. Loney, the author of the Caldecott Honor Book Double Bass Blues,  and award-winning artist Keith Mallett comes a remarkable story of fortitude, hope, and positivity.</p>

<p>Summary : August 30, 1975: the day fifteen-year-old Nola Kellergan is glimpsed fleeing through the woods, never to be heard from again; the day Somerset, New Hampshire, lost its innocence.Thirty-three years later, Marcus Goldman, a successful young novelist, visits Somerset to see his mentor, Harry Quebert, one of the country&#8217;s most respected writers, and to find a cure for his writer&#8217;s block as his publisher&#8217;s deadline looms. But Marcus&#8217;s plans are violently upended when Harry is suddenly and sensationally implicated in the cold-case murder of Nola Kellergan whom, he admits, he had an affair with. As the national media convicts Harry, Marcus launches his own investigation, following a trail of clues through his mentor&#8217;s books, the backwoods and isolated beaches of New Hampshire, and the hidden history of Somerset&#8217;s citizens and the man they hold most dear. To save Harry, his own writing career, and eventually even himself, Marcus must answer three questions, all of which are mysteriously </p>

It is one of the great epics of our time.

<p>Summary : As Los Angeles confronts a growing housing crisis, a city known for its single-family housing will inevitably shift toward a greater emphasis on apartments and other types of multi-family housing. Anderton?s book shows how connected dwellings work as good architecture and good social systems; multi-family housing itself will become an aspirational form of dwelling, not second in status or style to single family homes. For decades, the Los Angeles lifestyle has been equated with the suburban single-family home with a big backyard, yet L.A. has also been a laboratory for exceptional experiments in multifamily housing, from the courtyard to the rooftop garden, all centered on shared open space. In Common Multifamily Housing in Los Angeles , author Frances Anderton explores that fascinating history, from the bungalow courts and apartment-hotels of the 1910s, to the development of garden apartments, to contemporary mid-rise ?urban villages,? and experiments in co-living.

<p>Summary : An ambitious and shocking expos? of America&#8217;s hidden empire in Liberia, run by the storied Firestone corporation, and its long shadowIn the early 1920s, Americans owned 80 percent of the world&#8217;s automobiles and consumed 75 percent of the world&#8217;s rubber. But only one percent of the world&#8217;s rubber grew under the U.S. flag, creating a bottleneck that hampered the nation&#8217;s explosive economic expansion. To solve its conundrum, the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company turned to a tiny West African nation, Liberia, founded in 1847 as a free Black republic.Empire of Rubber tells a sweeping story of capitalism, racial exploitation, and environmental devastation, as Firestone transformed Liberia into America&#8217;s rubber empire.Historian and filmmaker Gregg Mitman scoured remote archives to unearth a history of promises unfulfilled for the vast numbers of Liberians who toiled on rubber plantations built on taken land. Mitman reveals a history of racial segregation and medical experimentation that </p>

<p>Summary : Nora&#8217;s life is about to get a rewrite&#8230;Nora Hamilton knows the formula for love better than anyone. As a romance channel screenwriter, it&#8217;s her job. But when her too-good-to work husband leaves her and their two kids, Nora turns her marriage&#8217;s collapse into cash and writes the best script of her life. No one is more surprised than her when it&#8217;s picked up for the big screen and set to film on location at her 100-year-old-home. When former Sexiest Man Alive, Leo Vance, is cast as her ne&#8217;er-do-well husband Nora&#8217;s life will never be the same.The morning after shooting wraps and the crew leaves, Nora finds Leo on her porch with a half-empty bottle of tequila and a proposition. He&#8217;ll pay a thousand dollars a day to stay for a week. The extra seven grand would give Nora breathing room, but it&#8217;s the need in his eyes that makes her say yes. Seven days: it&#8217;s the blink of an eye or an eternity depending on how you look at it. Enough time to fall in love. Enough time to break your heart.Filled </p>

<p>Summary : ?Don?t practice with Beck.? His voice was low, barely above a whisper. His gaze locked on mine. ?You want to practice? You practice with me.?The hot, commitment-phobe surfer is going to find me a boyfriend&#8230;but now he wants me for himself.In my small-town bookstore, I?m surrounded by book boyfriends, but I&#8217;ve never had one in real life. At almost 30, I?m painfully shy, I?ve never been in love, and my bookstore isn?t breaking even. Something needs to change, and I know exactly who?s going to help me?Wyatt Rhodes, the guy everyone wants.He agrees to be my relationship coach, but his lessons aren?t what I expected.Between surfing, mortifying dates, a town obsession with orc romance, and revamping my store into romance-only, his lessons are more about drawing me out of my shell than changing me into someone new. While we search for my Mr. Right, Wyatt and I become friends.The laid-back surfer is sweet and encouraging&#8230;until I go on a date with another guy, and Wyatt doesn&#8217;t want me </p>

You practice with me.?The hot, commitment-phobe surfer is going to find me a boyfriend&#8230;but now he wants me for himself.In my small-town bookstore, I?m surrounded by book boyfriends, but I&#8217;ve never had one in real life. At almost 30, I?m painfully shy, I?ve never been in love, and my bookstore isn?t breaking even. Something needs to change, and I know exactly who?s going to help me?Wyatt Rhodes, the guy everyone wants.He agrees to be my relationship coach, but his lessons aren?t what I expected.Between surfing, mortifying dates, a town obsession with orc romance, and revamping my store into romance-only, his lessons are more about drawing me out of my shell than changing me into someone new. While we search for my Mr. Right, Wyatt and I become friends.The laid-back surfer is sweet and encouraging&#8230;until I go on a date with another guy, and Wyatt doesn&#8217;t want me </p>

<p>Summary : An old nemesis. A secret technology. The outcome of a Great War at stake&#8230;Summer, 1914. As New England swelters, Detective Isaac Bell is asked to investigate a cache of missing rifles. But whoever broke into this Winchester factory wasn&#8217;t looking to take weapons &#8211; they wanted to leave something in the shipping crates: a radio transmitter, set to summon a fleet of dreaded German U-boats to their location in the seas.This means only one thing: someone is trying to keep American supplies from reaching British shores. If Bell doesn&#8217;t crack the conspiracy in time, the Atlantic Ocean will run red with blood.With the outcome of the war in the balance and Franklin Roosevelt&#8217;s orders on the line, Bell must confront an old enemy, and hunt down a new piece of technology that is allowing the Germans to rule the seas from New York to England. In the high-stakes, high seas pursuit of explosive suspense, Bell will risk everything to stop the U-boats, before they strike again&#8230;</p>

<p>Summary : La joven arque?loga Nora Kelly recibe una extraordinaria propuesta: liderar un equipo en busca del llamado ?Campamento perdido? de la expedici?n Donner. Su misterio se remonta a 1847, cuando un grupo de pioneros qued? atrapado en las monta?as de California y se perdi? su pista hasta que algunos fam?licos supervivientes pudieron salir del desierto, delirando sobre hambre, asesinatos&#8230; y canibalismo.Ahora, el sorprendente hallazgo del diario de una de las v?ctimas que contiene una enigm?tica descripci?n del campamento promete ser la pista definitiva para localizarlo. Nora acepta dirigir una expedici?n para revelar sus secretos tanto tiempo enterrados pero, una vez en las monta?as, se da cuenta de que este es solo el primer paso en una espeluznante aventura.Porque a medida que descubren antiguos huesos y monedas de oro, la verdad que sale a la luz es mucho m?s impactante y extra?a que el mero canibalismo. Y cuando esos horrores del pasado conducen a nueva violencia en el presente, la </p>

Su misterio se remonta a 1847, cuando un grupo de pioneros qued? atrapado en las monta?as de California y se perdi? su pista hasta que algunos fam?licos supervivientes pudieron salir del desierto, delirando sobre hambre, asesinatos&amp;#8230; y canibalismo.Ahora, el sorprendente hallazgo del diario de una de las v?ctimas que contiene una enigm?tica descripci?n del campamento promete ser la pista definitiva para localizarlo. Nora acepta dirigir una expedici?n para revelar sus secretos tanto tiempo enterrados pero, una vez en las monta?as, se da cuenta de que este es solo el primer paso en una espeluznante aventura.Porque a medida que descubren antiguos huesos y monedas de oro, la verdad que sale a la luz es mucho m?s impactante y extra?a que el mero canibalismo.

<p>Summary : For as long as she can remember, Gwendolyn Allister has never had a place to call home?all because her mother believes that monsters are hunting them. Now these delusions have brought them to London, far from the life Gwen had finally started to build for herself. The only saving grace is her best friend, Olivia, who?s coming with them for the summer. But when Gwen and Olivia are kidnapped by shadowy creatures and taken to a world of flesh-eating sea hags and dangerous Fey, Gwen realizes her mom might have been sane all along. The world Gwen finds herself in is called Neverland, yet it?s nothing like the stories. Here, good and evil lose their meaning and memories slip like water through her fingers.

With time running out and her enemies closing in, Gwen is forced </p>

<p>Summary : Kingdoms will fall, gods will die, and hearts will be broken in this sprawling new fantasy from New York Times bestselling author Jodi Meadows. In the middle of nothingness is the continent of Salvation.Reality bends easily here. Villages disappear. Forests burn forever. Pockets of inconsistent time are everywhere, their boundaries strung with yellow ribbon. And the three kingdoms of Salvation have been at war for a thousand years.But the greatest threat is the Malice, an incursion from the demon plane slowly tearing its way through the world&#8217;s weakest seams. Seams that&#8211;once split&#8211;will lead to the total unraveling of night and day, light and dark, life and death.Not that the human world takes much interest. Of more concern is the upcoming marriage of Rune Highcrown, Prince of Caberwill, and Johanne Fortuin, Princess of Embria&#8211;the serpent bride, a girl of famous cunning&#8211;which offers a possible end to the ancient conflict. But Rune has noticed the growing darkness, and he is </p>

<p>Summary : Eine Auseinandersetzung mit den Jahren der deutschen Teilung.Ende August 1961: In einem kleinen Krankenhauszimmer erwacht Rita Seidel aus ihrer Ohnmacht. Und mit dem Erwachen wird auch die Vergangenheit wieder lebendig. Da ist die Erinnerung an den Betriebsunfall und vor allem die Erinnerung an Manfred Herrfurth. Zwei Jahre sind vergangen, seit sie dem Chemiker in die Stadt folgte, um an seiner Seite und mit ihm gemeinsam ein gl?ckliches Leben zu beginnen. Wann hat die Trennung begonnen? Hat sie die ersten Anzeichen einer Entfremdung ?bersehen? Denken, Gr?beln, Fiebern ? Tage und N?chte hindurch! ?Ich gebe Dir Nachricht, wenn Du kommen sollst. Ich lebe nur f?r den Tag, da Du wieder bei mir bist.? Manfred ist von einem Chemikerkongre? in Westberlin nicht zur?ckgekehrt in dem festen Glauben, da? Rita ihm folgen wird. Sie mu? eine Entscheidung treffen, die sie in eine tiefe Krise st?rzt.</p>

<p>Summary : After years of war, Lincoln Sheppard thought he?d left the violence and ugliness behind. He was content with the life he built for himself. Then the woman down the street came in and shook everything up.  All Eden Brenner ever wanted was to have a place to call home. She finally found that in Hope Valley. Then she went and fell in love with the man a few houses down the first time she laid eyes on him. There was just one problem. Women like her didn?t catch the attention of men like him. He was totally and completely out of her league. And to make matters worse, when her past comes knocking, the beautiful world she?s built for herself is at risk of crumbling to the ground.  When danger forces Eden into his arms, Lincoln begins to see her in a whole new light, and he suddenly finds himself wanting things he never expected. And he wants them all with the shy, clumsy woman from down the street. But when the truth comes out, that proves nearly impossible. Now he?s fighting the hardest </p>

<p>Summary : The youngest-ever winner of the Griffin Prize mines his personal history in a brilliant new essay collection seeking to reconcile the world he was born into with the world that could be.

<p>Summary : La giovane Sadie Winters era un?adolescente ?problematica?. Per questo il suo salto nel vuoto dal tetto dell?esclusiva scuola privata che frequentava viene rapidamente classificato come suicidio. L?ultimo gesto disperato di una ragazza fragile. Quando per? un altro studente resta vittima di un fatale incidente nella stessa scuola, la detective Kim Stone fatica a credere che possa trattarsi di una tragica coincidenza. Tanto pi? che, nel corso delle indagini, Kim si rende conto che sull?istituto aleggia una pesante cappa di segreti e omert?, che non risparmia neppure gli insegnanti. Nessuno parla, nessuno sa nulla. Solo una professoressa sembra disposta a rompere il muro di silenzio, ma proprio quando Kim crede di essere vicina a ottenere le risposte che cerca, la donna viene trovata morta. Ormai ? chiaro che, finch? l?assassino non verr? fermato, nessuno dei ragazzi della scuola sar? al sicuro. Possibile che il responsabile di quegli efferati delitti si nasconda tra loro?</p>

<p>Summary : The Trees is a page-turner that opens with a series of brutal murders in the rural town of Money, Mississippi. When a pair of detectives from the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation arrive, they meet expected resistance from the local sheriff, his deputy, the coroner, and a string of racist White townsfolk.The murders present a puzzle, for at each crime scene there is a second dead body: that of a man who resembles Emmett Till, a young black boy lynched in the same town 65 years before.The detectives suspect that these are killings of retribution, but soon discover that eerily similar murders are taking place all over the country. Something truly strange is afoot. As the bodies pile up, the MBI detectives seek answers from a local root doctor who has been documenting every lynching in the country for years, uncovering a history that refuses to be buried.In this bold, provocative book, Everett takes direct aim at racism and police violence, and does so in a fast-paced style that </p>

Makeup, as we know it, has only been commercially available in the last 100 years, but applying decoration to the face and body may be one of the oldest global social practices. In Face Paint, Lisa Eldridge reveals the entire history of the art form, from Egyptian and Classical times up through the Victorian age and golden era of Hollywood, and also surveys the cutting-edge makeup science of today and tomorrow. Face Paint explores the practical and idiosyncratic reasons behind makeup?s use, the actual materials employed over generations, and the glamorous icons that people emulate and how they achieved their effects. An engaging history of style, it is also a social history of women and the ways in which we can understand their lives through the prism and impact of makeup.?</p>

<p>Summary : He?s a professional hockey player trying to survive on his new team. I?m just trying to survive.  I?m down to my last dollar. I live day-to-day in a world that doesn?t care. Despite my bad luck, I?m a fighter. I never give up. I never stop trying.  Ryan Parker&#8217;s wealth and generosity, sets him apart from anyone I know. Yet, I don?t trust him. It?s nothing personal. I trust no one.  But when my bad luck takes a turn for the worse, one person shows up. Ryan Parker.  I do not understand why he bothered because the guy has enough of his own issues to deal with. But I don?t have a choice. I need him. It?s a matter of survival.  His friendship changed everything. It changed me. I started to believe in myself. I allowed myself to trust. And for the first time, in a long time, I felt my heart beat again.  In the game of love, winning is harder than it looks. I don?t know the rules. I don?t know how to win. But I?ll play my heart out until the whistle blows.  Home Game.</p>

I tedeschi, a un passo dalla sconfitta, la stringono in una morsa sempre pi? spietata, gli alleati stentano ad arrivare, i romani combattono pagando con il sangue ogni atto di ribellione.

<p>Summary : The second in a new series of graphic novels from Hugo Award-winning author Liu Cixin and Talos Press The life-bringing sun is on track to have a catastrophic helium flash within the next four hundred years, which would wipe the Earth from the universe entirely. To survive, humanity constructs massive engines on Earth that keep running nonstop, gradually taking Earth out of the Sun?s orbit. Braking, escaping, and hostile living conditions wear down humanity?s hope. People who believe that civilization has already been destroyed form a rebel faction, carrying out a ruthless execution of those who still believe that the Sun will undergo a helium flash. The second of sixteen new graphic novels from Liu Cixin and Talos Press,?The Wandering Earth?is an epic tale of the future that all science fiction fans will enjoy.?</p>

<p>Summary : Already internationally acclaimed for his elegant, lucid writing on the most challenging notions in modern physics, Sean Carroll is emerging as one of the greatest humanist thinkers of his generation as he brings his extraordinary intellect to bear not only on Higgs bosons and extra dimensions but now also on our deepest personal questions. ?Where are we? Who are we? Are our emotions, our beliefs, and our hopes and dreams ultimately meaningless out there in the void??Does human purpose and meaning fit into a scientific worldview?In short chapters filled with intriguing historical anecdotes, personal asides, and rigorous exposition, readers learn the difference between how the world works at the quantum level, the cosmic level, and the human level&#8211;and then how each connects to the other. ?Carroll&#8217;s presentation of the principles that have guided the scientific revolution from Darwin and Einstein to the origins of life, consciousness, and the universe is dazzlingly unique.Carroll </p>

<p>Summary : Jack Tamerlaine hasn?t set foot on Cadence in ten long years, content to study music at the mainland university. But when young girls start disappearing from the isle, Jack is summoned home to help find them. Enchantments run deep on Cadence: gossip is carried by the wind; plaid shawls can be as strong as armor, and the smallest cut of a knife can instil fathomless fear. The capricious spirits that rule the isle by fire, water, earth, and wind find mirth in the lives of the humans who call the land home. Adaira, heiress of the east and Jack?s childhood enemy, knows the spirits only answer to a bard?s music, and she hopes Jack can draw them forth by song, enticing them to return the missing girls.As Jack and Adaira reluctantly work together, they find they make better allies than rivals as their partnership turns into something more. But with each passing song, it becomes apparent the trouble with the spirits is far more sinister than they first expected, and an older, darker secret </p>

<p>Summary : Jack Tamerlaine hasn?t set foot on Cadence in ten long years, content to study music at the mainland university. But when young girls start disappearing from the isle, Jack is summoned home to help find them. Enchantments run deep on Cadence: gossip is carried by the wind; plaid shawls can be as strong as armor, and the smallest cut of a knife can instil fathomless fear. The capricious spirits that rule the isle by fire, water, earth, and wind find mirth in the lives of the humans who call the land home. Adaira, heiress of the east and Jack?s childhood enemy, knows the spirits only answer to a bard?s music, and she hopes Jack can draw them forth by song, enticing them to return the missing girls.As Jack and Adaira reluctantly work together, they find they make better allies than rivals as their partnership turns into something more. But with each passing song, it becomes apparent the trouble with the spirits is far more sinister than they first expected, and an older, darker secret </p>

<p>Summary : Bestselling author Louise Penny pulls back the layers to reveal a brilliant and emotionally powerful truth in her latest spellbinding novel.When an intricate old map is found stuffed into the walls of the bistro in Three Pines, it at first seems no more than a curiosity.

<p>Summary : They worked Virginia&#8217;s tobacco fields, South Carolina&#8217;s rice marshes, and the Black Belt&#8217;s cotton plantations. Wherever they lived, enslaved people found their lives indelibly shaped by the Southern environment.

By night, they clandestinely took to the woods and swamps to trap opossums and turtles, to visit relatives living on adjacent plantations, and at times to escape slave patrols and escape to freedom.Scars on the Land is the first comprehensive history of American slavery to examine how the environment fundamentally formed enslaved people&#8217;s lives and how slavery remade the Southern landscape. Over two centuries, from the establishment of slavery in the Chesapeake to the Civil War, one simplecalculation had profound consequences: rather than measuring productivity based on outputs per acre, Southern </p>

<p>Summary : The interrelationship between journalism and public relations (PR) is one of the most contentious in the field of media studies. Numerous studies have shown that 50-80 per cent of the content of mass media is significantly shaped by PR. But many editors, journalists, and PR practitioners engage in a &#8216;discourse of denial&#8217;, maintaining what critics call the dirty secret of journalism &#8211; and PR. Media practitioners also engage in an accusatory &#8216;discourse of spin&#8217; and a &#8216;discourse of victimhood&#8217;. On the other hand, PR practitioners say they help provide a voice for organizations, including those ignored by the media. Meanwhile, the growth of social media is providing new opportunities for governments, corporations, and organizations to create content and even their own media, increasing the channels and reach of PR.  This book reviews 100 years of research into the interrelationship between journalism and PR and, based on in-depth interviews with senior editors, journalists, and PR </p>

He also covers topics such as why taking breaks in nature during the workday improves productivity; how planning a meeting beforehand makes it more effective; why an open-office plan isn?t a good office plan; how a more diverse team is a more potent team; what exactly about talking to co-workers online is so exhausting; why allowing for failure is vital to a company?s success; and many, many other topics.As ever, Medina?s charming descriptions and hilarious </p>

<p>Summary : The face of the pedestrian safety crisis looks a lot like Ignacio Duarte-Rodriguez. The 77-year old grandfather was struck in a hit-and-run crash while trying to cross a high-speed, six-lane road without crosswalks near his son?s home in Phoenix, Arizona. He was one of the more than 6,000 people killed while walking in America in 2018. In the last ten years, there has been a 50 percent increase in pedestrian deaths. The tragedy of traffic violence has barely registered with the media and wider culture. Disproportionately the victims are like Duarte-Rodriguez?immigrants, the poor, and people of color. They have largely been blamed and forgotten. In Right of Way, journalist Angie Schmitt shows us that deaths like Duarte-Rodriguez?s are not unavoidable ?accidents.? They don?t happen because of jaywalking or distracted walking. They are predictable, occurring in stark geographic patterns that tell a story about systemic inequality. These deaths are the forgotten faces of an increasingly </p>

<p>Summary : Standing in the Forest of Being Alive is a memoir-in-poems that reckons with erotic love even as the narrator is diagnosed and treated for breast cancer at the age of thirty-six during a time of pandemic and political upheaval. With humor and honesty, the book portrays both the pleasures and the horrors of the lover, the citizen, and the medical subject. How can we find, in the midst of hell, what isn?t hell? And whom can we tell how much we want to live? An intimate, hilarious and devastating look into some of the most private moments of a life?even if they happen to occur in a medical office with six strangers looking on. This book is for anyone who&#8217;s ever asked how to live in the face of suffering, and doesn&#8217;t expect an easy answer. Standing in the Forest of Being Alive looks unflinchingly at painful realities, posing the question &#8220;What isn&#8217;t hell?&#8221; and finds the answer in a powerful eros, letting a loved one pull laughter out of the narrator&#8217;s reluctant mouth like a </p>

<p>Summary : A kingdom in turmoil or the love of her life. Which one will she save? Elementalist Rielle hasn&#8217;t heard from her best friend in far too long. Yet no one at the Tower of Magic seems to care about Olivia?s silence, or the curtain of secrecy surrounding the distant capital. Before Rielle can investigate, she&#8217;s assigned a strange new mission: escort a paladin named Jon across the kingdom.  When whispers reveal mercenaries have killed the king, taken the capital, and that no one is coming to help, Rielle can?t leave Olivia in peril. But as infamous mages and deadly assassins hunt Jon, she can?t leave him unprotected either?especially as she finds herself falling for his strength, his passion, and his uncompromising goodness. Her past returns to haunt her, a werewolf stalks their steps, and an ancient evil is gathering, yet the restraints forbidding their love strain and snap one by one.  Saving Olivia and the kingdom means defying orders and sacrificing her every ambition, and could mean </p>

<p>Summary : By ancient definition, the adamant was known as both a diamond and a mythical stone of indestructible wonder. In more modern terminology, it describes a posture of unshakeable resolve and determination. If there was ever a time for us to be adamant about love and truth it is now. God is Love. God is Truth. Both love and truth are timeless, transcending our current trends and opinions. Sometimes the most loving thing we will ever do is to speak the truth, but speaking truth begins with living it.Using the mediums of Scripture and story, author Lisa Bevere takes readers on a journey to the one place they can learn not only to abide in God&#8217;s unshakeable truth and love, but become adamant&#8211;people who are unmovable, determined, and steadfast. Lisa unpacks the concept of the adamant for readers, linking together the grand story of Scripture and God&#8217;s purpose in their lives. God&#8217;s plan is revealed as we dwell in him, it is there that we are forged and shaped. As we abide in Christ our </p>

After I receive word of an inheritance, I end up back in Kansas, red bottom heels and all to take ownership of a house and property I haven?t set foot on in over a decade. My aunt Josephine chose me, the last of her living relatives, and now I?m left to discover what she wants done with her legacy. It?s a feat I?m willing to take on.  But the man I find in her bathroom is another story.  Grayden claims to be a handyman, previous help to my aunt in his well-worn jeans and smart attitude and as it turns out, he has a daughter who wants even less to do with me than I do with her father.

How did a man like that come to be such an important element to my late aunt?s life?  And why did my aunt Jo </p>

<p>Summary : Although Chitra Divakaruni&#8217;s poetry has won praise and awards for many years, it is her prose that is quickly making her one of the brightest rising stars in the changing face of American literature. Arranged Marriage, her first collection of stories, spent five weeks on the San Francisco Chronicle bestseller list and garnered critical acclaim that would have been extraordinary for even a more established author.For the young girls and women brought to life in these stories, the possibility of change, of starting anew, is both as terrifying and filled with promise as the ocean that separates them from their homes in India. From the story of a young bride whose fairy-tale vision of California is shattered when her husband is murdered and she must face the future on her own, to a proud middle-aged divorced woman determined to succeed in San Francisco, Divakaruni&#8217;s award-winning poetry fuses here with prose for the first time to create eleven devastating portraits of women on the verge </p>

<p>Summary : Although Chitra Divakaruni&#8217;s poetry has won praise and awards for many years, it is her prose that is quickly making her one of the brightest rising stars in the changing face of American literature. Arranged Marriage, her first collection of stories, spent five weeks on the San Francisco Chronicle bestseller list and garnered critical acclaim that would have been extraordinary for even a more established author.For the young girls and women brought to life in these stories, the possibility of change, of starting anew, is both as terrifying and filled with promise as the ocean that separates them from their homes in India. From the story of a young bride whose fairy-tale vision of California is shattered when her husband is murdered and she must face the future on her own, to a proud middle-aged divorced woman determined to succeed in San Francisco, Divakaruni&#8217;s award-winning poetry fuses here with prose for the first time to create eleven devastating portraits of women on the verge </p>

His success in the high-profile Dryden case &#8211; &#8216;the scandal of 1929&#8217; &#8211; catapulted him to the front pages of the national newspapers.

Dubbed &#8216;The Collingford Poisoner&#8217; by the press, Mary is accused of poisoning her husband after years of abuse.

<p>Summary : ?The first year is when some of us lose our lives. The second year is when the rest of us lose our humanity.? ?Xaden RiorsonEveryone expected Violet Sorrengail to die during her first year at Basgiath War College?Violet included. But Threshing was only the first impossible test meant to weed out the weak-willed, the unworthy, and the unlucky.Now the real training begins, and Violet?s already wondering how she?ll get through.

<p>Summary : All they want for Christmas is a different life.When chef Charlie Goodwin gets hit on the head on the L.A. set of her reality baking show, she loses a lot more than consciousness; she also loses her ability to taste and smell?both critical to her success as show judge. Meanwhile, Charlie&#8217;s identical twin, Cass, is frantically trying to hold her own life together back in their quaint mountain hometown while running the family&#8217;s bustling bakery and dealing with her ex, who won&#8217;t get the memo that they&#8217;re over.With only days until Christmas, a desperate Charlie asks Cass to do something they haven&#8217;t done since they were kids: switch places. Looking for her own escape from reality, Cass agrees. But temporarily trading lives proves more complicated than they imagined, especially when rugged firefighter Jake Greenman and gorgeous physician assistant Miguel Rodriguez are thrown into the mix. Will the twins&#8217; identity swap be a recipe for disaster, or does it have all the right ingredients </p>

<p>Summary : Red White &amp; Royal Blue meets Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell: debut author Freya Marske?s A Marvellous Light unfolds in an Edwardian England full of magic, contracts, and conspiracies. Robin Blyth has more than enough bother in his life. He?s struggling to be a good older brother, a responsible employer, and the harried baronet of a seat gutted by his late parents? excesses. When an administrative mistake sees him named the civil service liaison to a hidden magical society, he discovers what?s been operating beneath the unextraordinary reality he?s always known. Now, Robin must contend with the beauty and danger of magic, an excruciating deadly curse, and the alarming visions of the future that come with it &#8211; not to mention Edwin Courcey, his cold and prickly counterpart in the magical bureaucracy, who clearly wishes Robin were anyone and anywhere else. Robin?s predecessor has disappeared, and the mystery of what happened to him reveals unsettling truths about the very oldest </p>

<p>Summary : Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist Jose Antonio Vargas, called ?the most famous undocumented immigrant in America,? tackles one of the defining issues of our time in this explosive and deeply personal call to arms.?This is not a book about the politics of immigration. This book??at its core??is not about immigration at all.?This book is about homelessness, not in a traditional sense, but in the unsettled, unmoored psychological state that undocumented immigrants like myself find ourselves in. This book is about lying and being forced to lie to get by; about passing as an American and as a contributing citizen; about families, keeping them together, and having to make new ones when you can?t. This book is about constantly hiding from the government and, in the process, hiding from ourselves. This book is about what it means to not have a home.After 25 years of living illegally in a country that does not consider me one of its own, this book is the closest thing I have to freedom.??Jose </p>

<p>Summary : Friedrich Nietzsche&#8217;s work rocked the foundation of Western thinking, and continues to permeate our culture, high and low &#8211; yet he is one of history&#8217;s most misunderstood philosophers. Sue Prideaux&#8217;s myth-shattering book brings readers into the world of a brilliant, eccentric and deeply troubled man, illuminating the events and people that shaped his life and work. I Am Dynamite! is the essential biography for anyone seeking to understand Nietzsche, the philosopher who foresaw &#8211; and sought solutions to &#8211; our own troubled times.</p>

I fought him off? then went straight to the dean.He didn?t believe me. No one does.And now my date from hell is in revenge mode, and I somehow end up in the campus pool.Did I mention I can?t swim?Lucky for me, a knight in shining armor saves me from drowning.Except he?s not wearing shining armor. He?s naked.And he?s also Elite.Seriously, what is up with these Elite swimmers?Of course, I have no intention of ever seeing his very good-looking, naked highness again.Elite obviously can?t be trusted.Until he wraps me in his hoodie and promises to believe me.Now I?m drowning again?but this time in his enigmatic cobalt eyes and addictive touch.My only oxygen is him. I think I maybe could fall in love.But will he keep his promise when I tell him the truth about his teammate?Or will trusting Ryan </p>

<p>Summary : Practical ideas for using students&#8217; own languages within the language classroom. Translation and Own-language Activities provides structured, practical advice and guidance for using students&#8217; own languages within ELT classrooms. Taking into account both the growing interest and concerns about use of translation in English lessons, the book presents effective ways of integrating carefully chosen activities, covering themes such as tools, language skills, language focus and techniques. The practical activities range from using bilingual dictionaries to translating long texts, with a number of tasks drawing on easy-to-use web tools. The book also considers the relationship between translation and intercultural understanding.</p>

Never mind that Timoth?e looks exactly like an ancient god who tormented the world thousands of years ago.Never mind that on moonless nights, the Greywick siblings glow.When the triplets accidentally save a prince from a vampire attack, they?re not just the Greywicks anymore. They?re the Lost descendants of the gods, harboring unforetold magic. Now they?re bound for the Celestial Academy for Fallen Stars, whether they like it or not.A university in the sky.

<p>Summary : Matthew is a sixteen-year-old boy living in Jackson Heights, Queens, in 1976. After he loses his two most important male role models, his father and grandfather, his mother uses her inheritance to uproot Matthew and herself to a posh apartment building in Manhattan. Although only three miles away from his boyhood home, ?the city? is a completely new and strange world to Matthew. Matthew soon befriends (and becomes a quasi-assistant to) Lou Reed, who lives with his transgender girlfriend Rachel in the same building. The drug-addled, artistic/shamanic musician eventually becomes an unorthodox father figure to Matthew, who finds himself head over heels for the mysterious Veronica, a wise-beyond-her-years girl he meets at his new school. The novel is written from the point of view of Matthew at age eighteen, two years after the story begins, and concludes with an epilogue in the year 2013, three days after Lou Reed?s death, with Matthew in his fifties.</p>

<p>Summary : In Her Body and Other Parties, Carmen Maria Machado blithely demolishes the arbitrary borders between psychological realism and science fiction, comedy and horror, fantasy and fabulism. While her work has earned her comparisons to Karen Russell and Kelly Link, she has a voice that is all her own. In this electric and provocative debut, Machado bends genre to shape startling narratives that map the realities of women&#8217;s lives and the violence visited upon their bodies.A wife refuses her husband&#8217;s entreaties to remove the green ribbon from around her neck. A woman recounts her sexual encounters as a plague slowly consumes humanity. A salesclerk in a mall makes a horrifying discovery within the seams of the store&#8217;s prom dresses. One woman&#8217;s surgery-induced weight loss results in an unwanted houseguest. And in the bravura novella Especially Heinous, Machado reimagines every episode of Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit, a show we naively assumed had shown it all, generating a </p>

<p>Summary : The Barnes &amp; Noble ReviewFrom the bestselling author of Last Man Standing and Absolute Power comes another high-tension thriller guaranteed to get your heart hammering.Sean King is a former Secret Service agent who, eight years ago, botched the job of protecting a presidential candidate. When he meets Michelle Maxwell, an attractive agent whose political charge has just been kidnapped, the two disgraced operatives uncover an ominous connection between the incidents. They team up, and &#8212; as bodies begin to pile up &#8212; they find themselves racing against the clock to prevent an assassin from striking again along the campaign trail.A masterful craftsman, Baldacci manipulates his story line with great effectiveness, creating a sense of danger and foreboding and imbuing even secondary characters with enough depth and dimension to rescue them from stereotypes. Conspiracies and mysteries abound in this taut mystery that weaves together action-packed scenarios and solid emotional impact. </p>

When he meets Michelle Maxwell, an attractive agent whose political charge has just been kidnapped, the two disgraced operatives uncover an ominous connection between the incidents. They team up, and &amp;#8212; as bodies begin to pile up &amp;#8212; they find themselves racing against the clock to prevent an assassin from striking again along the campaign trail.A masterful craftsman, Baldacci manipulates his story line with great effectiveness, creating a sense of danger and foreboding and imbuing even secondary characters with enough depth and dimension to rescue them from stereotypes. Conspiracies and mysteries abound in this taut mystery that weaves together action-packed scenarios and solid emotional impact.

<p>Summary : The landline rings as Agneta is waving off her grandchildren. Just one word comes out of the receiver: &#8216;Geiger&#8217;. For decades, Agneta has always known that this moment would come, but she is shaken. She knows what it means. Retrieving her weapon from its hiding place, she attaches the silencer and creeps up behind her husband before pressing the barrel to his temple. Then she squeezes the trigger and disappears &#8211; leaving behind her wallet and keys. The extraordinary murder is not Sara Nowak&#8217;s case. But she was once close to those affected and, defying regulations, she joins the investigation. What Sara doesn&#8217;t know is that the mysterious codeword is just the first piece in the puzzle of an intricate and devastating plot fifty years in the making.</p>

<p>Summary : There would be blood. Blood for blood. Blood to pay. An entire world of it.For the resistance in 1950s Germany, the war may be over, but the fight has just begun.Death camp survivor Yael, who has the power to skinshift, is on the run: the world has just seen her shoot and kill Hitler. But the truth of what happened is far more complicated, and its consequences are deadly. Yael and her unlikely comrades dive into enemy territory to try to turn the tide against the New Order, and there is no alternative but to see their mission through to the end, whatever the cost.But dark secrets reveal dark truths, and one question hangs over them all: how far can you go for the ones you love?</p>

<p>Summary : Featured title on PBS&#8217;s The Great American Read in 2018Earphones Award Winner (AudioFile Magazine)Of all of John Irving&#8217;s books, this is the one that lends itself best to audio. In print, Owen Meany&#8217;s dialogue is set in capital letters; for this production, Irving himself selected Joe Barrett to deliver Meany&#8217;s difficult voice as intended.In the summer of 1953, two 11-year-old boys ? best friends ? are playing in a Little League baseball game in Gravesend, New Hampshire. One of the boys hits a foul ball that kills the other boy&#8217;s mother. The boy who hits the ball doesn&#8217;t believe in accidents; Owen Meany believes he is God&#8217;s instrument. What happens to Owen after that 1953 foul ball is extraordinary and terrifying.As an added bonus, when you purchase our Audible Modern Vanguard production of John Irving&#8217;s book, you&#8217;ll also get an exclusive Jim Atlas interview that begins when the audiobook ends.</p>

<p>    New York Times best selling author William R. Forstchen now brings us a story which can be all too terrifyingly real&#8230;a story in which one man struggles to save his family and his small North Carolina town after America loses a war, in one second, a war that will send America back to the Dark Ages&#8230;A war based upon a weapon, an Electro Magnetic Pulse (EMP).

<p>    Months before publication, One Second After has already been cited on the floor of Congress as a book all Americans should read, a book already being discussed in the corridors of the Pentagon as a truly realistic look at a weapon and its awesome power to destroy the entire United States, literally within one second.

In the tradition of On the Beach, Fail Safe and Testament, this book, set in a typical American town, is a dire warning of what might be our future&#8230;and our </p>
