<p>Summary : Founder Ellie Laks started The Gentle Barn after adopting a sick goat from a run-down petting zoo in 1999. Some two hundred animals later (including chickens, horses, pigs, cows, rabbits, emus, and more), The Gentle Barn has become an extraordinary nonprofit that brings together a volunteer staff of community members and at-risk teens to rehabilitate abandoned and/or abused animals. As Ellie teaches the volunteers to care for the animals, they learn a new language of healing that works wonders on the humans as well. My Gentle Barn weaves together the story of how the Barn came to be what it is today with Ellie&#8217;s own journey. Filled with heartwarming animal stories and inspiring recoveries, The Gentle Barn is a feel-good account that will delight animal lovers and memoir readers alike.</p>

Last year had been all about football and parties, not schoolwork.

<p>Summary : What happened to Amanda Holmes?Twenty years ago, she was found bludgeoned in a rowboat at the MacAllister family?s Camp Macaw. No one was ever charged with the crime.Now, after their parents? sudden deaths, the MacAllister siblings return to camp to read the will and decide what to do with the prime real estate the camp occupies. Ryan needs to sell. Margaux hasn?t made up her mind. Mary believes in leaving well enough alone. Kate and Liddie?the twins?have opposing views. And Sean Booth, the groundskeeper, just hopes he still has a home when all is said and done.But it?s more complicated than a simple vote. The will stipulates that until they unravel the mystery of what happened to Amanda, they can?t settle the estate. Any one of them could have done it, and each one is holding a piece of the puzzle. Will they work together to finally discover the truth, or will their secrets finally tear the family apart?</p>

<p>Summary : 1929. The author&#8217;s West Indian mail boat lay at anchor in a tropical green gulf. At the water&#8217;s edge, lit by sunset, sprawled the town of Cap Haitien. Among the modern structures were the wrecked mansions of the 16th century French colonials who imported slaves from Africa and made Haiti the richest colony in the western hemisphere. In the ruins was the palace built for Pauline Bonaparte when Napoleon sent his brother-in-law with an imperial army to do battle with slaves who had won their freedom. All this was panoramic as they lay at anchor, but as night fell, it faded to vagueness and disappeared. Only the jungle mountains remained, dark, mysterious; and from their slopes came presently far across the water the steady boom of Voodoo drums.</p>

<p>Summary : &#8216;Thank god for Richard Sennett &#8230; essential reading for all students of the city&#8217; Anna Minton, Prospect&#8217;Constantly stimulating ideas from a veteran of urban thinking&#8217; Jonathan Meades, GuardianIn Building and Dwelling, Richard Sennett distils a lifetime&#8217;s thinking and practical experience to explore the relationship between the good built environment and the good life. He argues for, and describes in rich detail, the idea of an open city, one in which people learn to manage complexity. He shows how the design of cities can enrich or diminish the everyday experience of those who dwell in them.The book ranges widely &#8211; from London, Paris and Barcelona to Shanghai, Mumbai and Medellin in Colombia &#8211; and draws on classic thinkers such as Tocqueville, Heidegger, Max Weber, and Walter Benjamin. It also draws on Sennett&#8217;s many decades as a practical planner himself, testing what works, what doesn&#8217;t, and why. He shows what works ethically is often the most practical solution for cities&#8217; </p>

<p>Summary : Throughout history the cat has been an indomitable influence on societies and cultures, first as goddess, then as demon, and now as hero and social media empress. Man&#8217;s view of the cat has come full circle. As both mascot and muse to great adventurers, writers, artists and statesmen, the cat has offered comfort and inspiration. Never obsequious or ordinary, always elegant and inscrutable, the cat has played a fundamental role in civilization through the centuries, and this is its story.-Find out why women and cats have been bound together throughout history.-Ever wondered why the black cat is considered bad luck; why cats were considered good luck on ships and planes?-The answers to these questions and many more are here in this easy to read and fully referenced cat history with over 150 black and white illustrations.</p>

<p>Summary : Have you ever lain awake at night fretting over how we can be sure of the reality of the external world? Perhaps we are in fact disembodied brains, floating in vats at the whim of some deranged puppet-master? If so, you are not alone &#8211; and what&#8217;s more, you are in exalted company. For this question and other ones like it have been the stuff of philosophical rumination from Plato to Popper. In a series of accessible and engagingly written essays, &#8220;50 Philosophy Ideas You Really Need to Know&#8221; introduces and explains the problems of knowledge, consciousness, identity, ethics, belief, justice and aesthetics that have engaged the attention of thinkers from the era of the ancient Greeks to the present day.</p>

<p>Summary : In Negotiating Opportunities, Jessica McCrory Calarco argues that the middle class has a negotiated advantage in school. Drawing on five years of ethnographic fieldwork, Calarco traces that negotiated advantage from its origins at home to its consequences at school. Through their parents&#8217; coaching, working-class students learn to follow rules and work through problems independently. Middle-class students learn to challenge rules and request assistance, accommodations, and attention in excess of what is fair or required. Teachers typically grant those requests, creating advantages for middle-class students. Calarco concludes with recommendations, advocating against deficit-oriented programs that teach middle-class behaviors to working-class students. Those programs ignore the value of working-class students&#8217; resourcefulness, respect, and responsibility, and they do little to prevent middle-class families from finding new opportunities to negotiate advantages in school.</p>

<p>Summary : Pocket Change Collective was born out of a need for space. Space to think. Space to connect. Space to be yourself. And this is your invitation to join us. In Continuum,  fine artist, activist, and Titans actor Chella Man uses his own experiences as a deaf, transgender, genderqueer, Jewish person of color to talk about cultivating self-acceptance and acting as one&#8217;s own representation.Pocket Change Collective is a series of small books with big ideas from today&#8217;s leading activists and artists.What constructs in your life must you unlearn to support inclusivity and respect for all? This is a question that artist, actor, and activist Chella Man wrestles with in this powerful and honest essay. A story of coping and resilience, Chella journeys through his experiences as a deaf, transgender, genderqueer, Jewish person of color, and shows us that identity lies on a continuum &#8212; a beautiful, messy, and ever-evolving road of exploration.</p>

<p>Summary : Ercole Santi? trascorre l?infanzia ricucendo gli strappi quotidiani della vita. Lui e sua sorella Asia tirano avanti a stento ? con fantasia e caparbiet? ? insieme al padre, un personaggio tanto inadeguato quanto innocente; eppure, come tutti, crescono, vanno a scuola, s?innamorano. Finch?, all?improvviso, ogni cosa attorno a Ercole inizia a crollare. Niente sembra in grado di fermare la slavina che lo sta travolgendo, nemmeno Viola, la ragazza che da qualche tempo illumina i suoi giorni. Convinto che quello di incasinarsi sia un destino scritto nel sangue della propria famiglia, ? sul punto di arrendersi quando viene a sapere che la madre, di cui non ha notizie da anni, abita non lontano da lui. L?incontro con la donna lo metter? di fronte alla necessit? di reagire compiendo una scelta drammatica. L?unica possibile, forse, se vuole cambiare il proprio destino e proteggere le persone che ama.</p>

<p>Summary : Traditionally, Americans have?viewed war as an alternative to diplomacy, and military strategy as the science of victory.? Today, however, in our world of nuclear weapons, military power is not so much exercised? as threatened.? It is, Mr. Schelling says, bargaining power, and the exploitation of this power, for good or evil, to preserve peace or to threaten war, is diplomacy?the diplomacy of violence.? The author concentrates in this book on the way in which military capabilities?real or imagined?are used, skillfully or clumsily, as bargaining power.? He sees the steps taken by the U.S. during the Berlin and Cuban crises as not merely preparations for engagement, but as signals to an enemy, with reports from the adversary&#8217;s own military intelligence as our most important diplomatic communications.? Even the bombing of North Vietnam, Mr. Schelling points out, is as much coercive as tactical, aimed at decisions as much as bridges.? He carries forward the analysis so brilliantly begun </p>

<p>Summary : Richard P. Feynman, premio Nobel per la fisica nel 1965, ? stato uno dei maggiori fisici teorici del XX secolo. La sua vita, lungi dal rimanere confinata entro i limiti dell&#8217;impegno strettamente scientifico, ci si presenta in questo libro come un&#8217;esplosiva miscela di eventi incredibili resi possibili da quell&#8217;impasto del tutto unico di acuta intelligenza, curiosit? irrefrenabile, costante scetticismo e radicato umorismo che ? stato l&#8217;uomo Feynman. ? davvero straordinario poter ritrovare nella stessa persona un tal numero di esperienze diverse e talora contraddittorie. Egli ha, di volta in volta, scassinato le pi? sicure casseforti di Los Alamos, dove si custodivano i segreti della bomba atomica, suonato la frigideira in una scuola di samba brasiliana, illustrato la fisica a &#8220;menti mostruose&#8221; come Einstein, von Neumann e Pauli, e lavorato come suonatore di bongos con una coreografa di successo, per tacere poi della sua attivit? di pittore, o di biologo, o di frequentatore di case da </p>

<p>Summary : From the back cover:My name is Penny Stewart and I&#8217;m a lesbian. I didn&#8217;t know that&#8217;s what I was until I moved to Greenwich Village and encountered Marcella. She showed me, all right, and pretty soon we were living together.All things considered, life was pretty good &#8211; that is, until I met Bernice. Then I began to understand how Marcella felt about me, because that&#8217;s exactly how I felt about Bernice. I had to have her. Only one thing was different. Bernice wasn&#8217;t a lesbian. So I planned her seduction carefully. But I didn&#8217;t count on trouble from her fiance, Mark Hughes. Nor did I count on Marcella&#8217;s jealousy and my own desire that soon grew into an obsession I couldn&#8217;t control and which threatened to destroy us all in its violence.</p>

<p>Summary : It is the Year 2038, The New Era, it is a time where the world has become a paradise. Violence, war, hate and crime is no more. The earth is now one big sphere full of happiness and good will, all thanks to a suppressant that increases Mankinds good nature to one another and obedience to authority while suppressing everything else. Eva, a beautiful and compassionate young woman has a secret. She is immune to the substance and has what no one else does, freewill. Freewill, the only crime. Immunities are criminals in The New Era and are tracked by The System, an Agency funded by the Government. One day, unexpected by her, Eva meets Bishop, a mysterious and strangely immune young man. From that moment, her life and The New Era will never be the same again.</p>

<p>Summary : In The Heart of Christianity, world-renowned Jesus scholar and author of the bestseller Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time argues that the essential ingredients of a Christian life?faith, being born again, the kingdom of God, the gospel of love?are as vitally important today as they have always been, even during this time of conflict and change in the church.Borg wants to show us, as today&#8217;s thinking Christians, how to discover a life of faith by reconceptualizing familiar beliefs. Being born again, for example, has nothing to do with fundamentalism, but is a call to radical personal transformation. Talking about the kingdom of God does not mean that you are fighting against secularism, but that you have committed your life to the divine values of justice and love. And living the true Christian way is essentially about opening one&#8217;s heart?to God, and to others. Above all else, Borg believes with passion and conviction that living the Christian life still makes sense.</p>

<p>Summary : In The Heart of Christianity, world-renowned Jesus scholar and author of the bestseller Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time argues that the essential ingredients of a Christian life?faith, being born again, the kingdom of God, the gospel of love?are as vitally important today as they have always been, even during this time of conflict and change in the church.Borg wants to show us, as today&#8217;s thinking Christians, how to discover a life of faith by reconceptualizing familiar beliefs. Being born again, for example, has nothing to do with fundamentalism, but is a call to radical personal transformation. Talking about the kingdom of God does not mean that you are fighting against secularism, but that you have committed your life to the divine values of justice and love. And living the true Christian way is essentially about opening one&#8217;s heart?to God, and to others. Above all else, Borg believes with passion and conviction that living the Christian life still makes sense.</p>

Two years later, she was sentenced to life in prison.Brown reflects on the isolation, low self-esteem, and sense of alienation that drove her straight into the hands of a predator.

<p>Summary : The Scorpion?s Mate Claire has never really fit in with everyone around her, but she&#8217;s carved out a life for herself using her own unique style and artistic ability to support herself on the Internet. The last thing she expects is to be abducted by aliens and dropped into a research facility, where a genetically-engineered alien soldier chooses her as his life-mate. Thrax?s pheromones are compelling, and his status as a fellow unwilling test subject makes them allies, but Claire isn&#8217;t certain she can trust someone who is convinced she belongs to him, when all she wants to do is find a way to return home to Earth?a place that her devoted alien can never follow, because there?s no way the scorpion-like alien would ever be able to pass for human. Still, she?ll accept help where she can find it, so she doesn&#8217;t hesitate to escape with Thrax from the facility, though their time running from their pursuers in the warrens beneath the research facility will forever change Claire, and could </p>

<p>Summary : The Scorpion?s Mate Claire has never really fit in with everyone around her, but she&#8217;s carved out a life for herself using her own unique style and artistic ability to support herself on the Internet. The last thing she expects is to be abducted by aliens and dropped into a research facility, where a genetically-engineered alien soldier chooses her as his life-mate. Thrax?s pheromones are compelling, and his status as a fellow unwilling test subject makes them allies, but Claire isn&#8217;t certain she can trust someone who is convinced she belongs to him, when all she wants to do is find a way to return home to Earth?a place that her devoted alien can never follow, because there?s no way the scorpion-like alien would ever be able to pass for human.

<p>Summary : Do you practise meditation because you want to feel good? Or to help you relax and be ?happy?? Then frankly, according to Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse, you are far better off having a full-body massage than trying to practise the Dharma.  Khyentse shows that genuine spiritual practice, not least the Ng?ndro preliminaries, will not bring the kind of comfort and ease most worldly people crave. Quite the opposite, in fact. But if your ultimate goal is enlightenment, Ng?ndro practice is a must, and Not for Happiness your perfect guide, containing everything an aspiring practitioner needs to start to practise, including advice about: ??????renunciation mind??????discipline, meditation and wisdom??????using your imagination in visualisation practice?????why we need a guru Students? Reactions to Not for Happiness:  ?Having a map of the path that shows where each practice is headed helps me to see what each stage is preparing me for.

<p>Summary : TO TRY ONE SPOONFUL OF CIAO BELLA?S GELATO OR SORBETTO IS TO BE INSTANTLY TRANSPORTED. When you think of the most delicious and fresh gelato and sorbetto in America, you are craving Ciao Bella. The premier gelato and sorbetto maker in the country may be known for using the world?s finest ingredients?Sicilian lemons, Valrhona chocolate, Louisiana pralines?but you don?t need to travel the globe to experience the bold flavors yourself. All you need is a handful of simple, fresh ingredients; a standard ice cream machine; and your imagination. The magic of this book is that once you learn how to make just one easy custard or simple syrup base, you can dream up an infinite number of flavors. In addition to being able to re-create Ciao Bella?s award-winning favorites, like Key Lime with Graham Cracker Gelato or Hazelnut Biscotti Gelato, you?ll be able to invent your own combina?tions and mix and match more than 100 unbeliev?ably indulgent frozen desserts.

When you think of the most delicious and fresh gelato and sorbetto in America, you are craving Ciao Bella. The premier gelato and sorbetto maker in the country may be known for using the world?s finest ingredients?Sicilian lemons, Valrhona chocolate, Louisiana pralines?but you don?t need to travel the globe to experience the bold flavors yourself. All you need is a handful of simple, fresh ingredients; a standard ice cream machine; and your imagination. The magic of this book is that once you learn how to make just one easy custard or simple syrup base, you can dream up an infinite number of flavors. In addition to being able to re-create Ciao Bella?s award-winning favorites, like Key Lime with Graham Cracker Gelato or Hazelnut Biscotti Gelato, you?ll be able to invent your own combina?tions and mix and match more than 100 unbeliev?ably indulgent frozen desserts.

<p>Summary : ?Considered one of the most subtle and beautifully written lesbian novels of the century, this 1949 classic returns to print in a Cleis Press edition. Dorothy Strachey?s classic Olivia captures the awakening passions of an English adolescent sent away for a year to a small finishing school outside Paris. The innocent but watchful Olivia develops an infatuation for her headmistress, Mlle. Julie, and through this screen of love observes the tense romance between Mlle. Julie and the other head of the school, Mlle. Cara, in its final months. ?Although not strictly autobiographical, Olivia draws on the author?s experiences at finishing schools run by the charismatic Mlle. Marie Souvestre, whose influence lived on through former students like Natalie Barney and Eleanor Roosevelt. Olivia was dedicated to the memory of Strachey?s friend Virginia Woolf and published to acclaim in 1949. Colette wrote the screenplay for the 1951 film adaptation of the novel. In 1999, Olivia was included on the </p>

<p>Summary : Have you noticed things mysteriously move around? Keys don&#8217;t stay put, wallets transport to different places, and socks go missing from the laundry. We observe reality shifts when things appear, disappear, transform or transport and when we experience changes in time. Reality shifts range from the sublime (missing socks and synchronicity) to completely astonishing (the dead seen alive again; objects appearing out of thin air; spontaneous remission; traveling far in a very short time). Learn how to live lucidly to create a life you love, positively influence the future and the past, and transform sabotage into strength. &#8220;Cynthia Larson helps restore a sense of majesty and wonder to our everyday world. If you think science has explained away the magic of existence, you need seriously to read this book.&#8221; ? Larry Dossey, M.D. &#8220;I recommend this book for its clarity and for its message of hope.&#8221; ? Fred Alan Wolf, Ph.D. &#8220;Read, enjoy, be amazed, ponder REALITY SHIFTS.&#8221; ?

<p>Summary : We spend 50 to 75 percent of our waking hours and 60 to 90 percent of the years of our lives working. Yet many of us never invest even a fraction of that time exploring the vision that drives our lives and work.Whether or not we think of ourselves as theologians, none of us can avoid having a theology that shapes our lives.

Now, in this exploration of vocation that has the potential to radically reorder our lives, Miller lays out the thought background necessary for each of us to establish a meaningful, integrated understanding of our life and work.

<p>Summary : From a New York Times best-selling author, psychotherapist, and national advice columnist, a hilarious, thought-provoking, and surprising new book that takes us behind the scenes of a therapist&#8217;s world?where her patients are looking for answers (and so is she). One day, Lori Gottlieb is a therapist who helps patients in her Los Angeles practice. The next, a crisis causes her world to come crashing down. Enter Wendell, the quirky but seasoned therapist in whose office she suddenly lands. With his balding head, cardigan, and khakis, he seems to have come straight from Therapist Central Casting. Yet he will turn out to be anything but. As Gottlieb explores the inner chambers of her patients&#8217; lives?a self-absorbed Hollywood producer, a young newlywed diagnosed with a terminal illness, a senior citizen threatening to end her life on her birthday if nothing gets better, and a twenty-something who can&#8217;t stop hooking up with the wrong guys?she finds that the questions they are struggling </p>

<p>Summary : For more than fifty years, Lorraine Warren-a validated clairvoyant-and her husband Ed Warren-a respected demonologist-have been tracking paranormal phenomena around the world. Ghost Tracks pulls together five decades of field research experience, along with historic, scientific, and religious perspectives to reveal that even the paranormal have predictable patterns of behavior. These patterns enable the Warrens to discern what is happening and why. Lectures and selected case studies and letters demonstrate what it is like to live with, investigate, and resolve the mystery of ghosts, poltergeist, and evil infestations. Ghost Tracks has a refreshing style making it an easy read, entertaining as well as informative.</p>

<p>Summary : Anna had never met an Alpha&#8230;until the day her city fell to an Uncorrupted attack. Injured, loaded with pain-suppressants, and exhausted after a night spent fleeing, it was the worst possible time to find herself plastered against a man like Hudson&#8230;.And the worst possible time to reveal her Omega dynamic. She can&#8217;t tear her gaze away from the big, intimidating man, who makes his lack of interest clear. Two years later, and Hudson has been allocated as Anna&#8217;s Controller. Neither of them is happy. But neither of them has a choice. And being forced to work together, might just break them both.</p>

<p>Summary : Terry wants to stand out. But, in Coral Reef City, it?s sometimes better to blend in?Coral Reef City is home to the most dazzling shoals of tropical fish in ALL the ocean. And then there is Terry. Terry looks grey. Terry feels dull. And although he is the best at playing ?Hide A Fish?, he can?t help but wonder: Just what would it feel like to be part of that dashing, flashing crew? So, with the help of his friends, he fashions a flashy costume and is ready to impress? ?Hello-o-o everybody! Just call me TROPICAL Terry!? But will life as a tropical fish be everything he dreamed of?With his trademark humour and vibrant art, the award-winning Jarvis tells a heart-warming comedy of self-esteem; a story about learning to love your own scales and take pride in what makes you different.</p>

<p>Summary : Change the world one trip at a time. In this illuminating collection of stories and lessons from the road, acclaimed travel writer Rick Steves shares a powerful message that resonates now more than ever.With the world facing divisive events and movements like the rise of nationalism, Trump, Brexit, Erdogan, and more, there&#8217;s never been a more important time to travel.Rick believes the risks of travel are widely exaggerated, and that fear is for people who don&#8217;t get out much. After years of living out of a suitcase, he still marvels at how different cultures may find different truths to be self-evident. By sharing his experiences from Europe, Central America, Asia, and the Middle East, Rick shows how we can learn more about own country by viewing it from afar.With gripping stories from Rick&#8217;s decades of exploration, this fully revised edition of Travel as a Political Act is an antidote to the current climate of xenophobia. When we travel thoughtfully, we bring back the most beautiful </p>

<p>Summary : In Morgoth&#8217;s Ring, the tenth volume of The History of Middle-earth and the first of two companion volumes, Christopher Tolkien describes and documents the legends of the Elder Days, as they were evolved and transformed by his father in the years before he completed The Lord of the Rings. The text of the Annals of Aman, the &#8220;Blessed Land&#8221; in the far West, is given in full. And in writings never before published, we can see the nature of the problems that J.R.R. Tolkien explored in his later years as new and radical ideas, portending upheaval in the heart of the mythology. At this time Tokien sought to redefine the old legends, and wrote of the nature and destiny of Elves, the idea of Elvish rebirth, the origins of the Orcs, and the Fall of Men. His meditation of mortality and immortality as represented in the lives of Men and Elves led to another major writing at this time, the &#8220;Debate of Finrod and Andreth,&#8221; which is reproduced here in full. &#8220;Above all,&#8221; Christopher Tolkien writes in </p>

<p>Summary : Wir waren perfekt f?reinander ? bis wir uns trafenMisha und Ryen sind Brieffreunde. Sie haben sich ?ber Jahre hinweg all ihre Geheimnisse, Sorgen und W?nsche anvertraut ? und sie haben drei Regeln: kein Kontakt im echten Leben, keine sozialen Medien und keine Bilder. Denn das, was sie miteinander haben, ist perfekt. Warum es also ruinieren? Als Misha sich dennoch ?ber die Abmachung hinwegsetzt und Ryen aufsucht, steht vor ihm nicht die nerdige Au?enseiterin mit Brille und Gedichtb?nden im Rucksack, f?r die er sie hielt, sondern eine blonde Cheerleaderin, die den anderen Sch?lern das Leben zur H?lle macht. Misha ist schockiert, entt?uscht, w?tend, und er hasst Ryen sofort ? leidenschaftlich!</p>

<p>Summary : Conquer the most essential adaptation to the knowledge economyThe Fearless Organization: Creating Psychological Safety in the Workplace for Learning, Innovation, and Growth offers practical guidance for teams and organizations who are serious about success in the modern economy. With so much riding on innovation, creativity, and spark, it is essential to attract and retain quality talent&#8211;but what good does this talent do if no one is able to speak their mind? The traditional culture of &#8220;fitting in&#8221; and &#8220;going along&#8221; spells doom in the knowledge economy. Success requires a continuous influx of new ideas, new challenges, and critical thought, and the interpersonal climate must not suppress, silence, ridicule or intimidate. Not every idea is good, and yes there are stupid questions, and yes dissent can slow things down, but talking through these things is an essential part of the creative process. People must be allowed to voice half-finished thoughts, ask questions from left field, </p>

With so much riding on innovation, creativity, and spark, it is essential to attract and retain quality talent&#8211;but what good does this talent do if no one is able to speak their mind? The traditional culture of &#8220;fitting in&#8221; and &#8220;going along&#8221; spells doom in the knowledge economy. Success requires a continuous influx of new ideas, new challenges, and critical thought, and the interpersonal climate must not suppress, silence, ridicule or intimidate. Not every idea is good, and yes there are stupid questions, and yes dissent can slow things down, but talking through these things is an essential part of the creative process. People must be allowed to voice half-finished thoughts, ask questions from left field, </p>

And that is when the dangerously sexy Seelie King rolls through town, looking for fae like me. Every generation, the king holds a competition for Seelie queen. But for reasons he won?t explain, Torin is looking for a charade, not a real marriage. So when I drunkenly sling insults his way, I have his attention. When Torin offers me fifty million to participate, I think, ?What have I got to lose?? The answer turns out to be ?my life,? because my competition will literally kill for the crown.

<p>Summary : Mal angenommen es war nicht fr?her alles besser ? sondern wird es erst in der Zukunft: Wie w?rde die ideale Welt 2040 in Bezug auf fossile Brennstoffe, Mobilit?t und Ern?hrung aussehen? Und w?re sie auch praktisch umsetzbar? Jan Hegenberg zeigt in seinem Buch faktenbasiert, aber trotzdem mit einer ordentlichen Prise Humor, wie wir die Energiewende angehen k?nnen, wie St?dte ohne Autos aussehen und funktionieren w?rden und warum Fleisch und Milch zwei nette Spielereien f?r Menschen des letzten Jahrhunderts sind. Dabei seziert er genussvoll und unterhaltsam die Fehlinformationen, denen wir zu dem Thema Klimawende aufgesessen sind, und zeigt, wie gut wir 2040 klimaneutral leben k?nnen.</p>

<p>Summary : Ruled or Misruled, Story and Destiny of Bihar by The Indian Express? Assistant Editor SANTOSH SINGH offers a 360 degree journey of Bihar politics since Independence, especially since the Congress? downfall in 1990. An out and out reporter?s book, it tells an interesting and tumultuous journey of the post-1990 legends of Bihar politics &#8211; Nitish Kumar, Lalu Prasad, Ram Vilas Paswan and Jitan Ram Manjhi with the legendary clash between Nitish Kumar and Narendra Modi &#8211; with the untold version on the 2010 dinner cancellation and Nitish?s ambition, providing the third angle. Right from revealing JP?s dilemma between Lalu and Nitish to socialist leader Karpoori Thakur out-thinking the Congress with his simplicity. From Jagannath Mishra making a confession on his controversial 1982 Anti-Press Bill to the numerous tales of vernaculariszation of politics and giving a voice to the poor by Lalu, the writer also traces the story of the making of the Ranbir Sena at the height of caste wars.

<p>Summary : Ruled or Misruled, Story and Destiny of Bihar by The Indian Express? Assistant Editor SANTOSH SINGH offers a 360 degree journey of Bihar politics since Independence, especially since the Congress? downfall in 1990. An out and out reporter?s book, it tells an interesting and tumultuous journey of the post-1990 legends of Bihar politics &#8211; Nitish Kumar, Lalu Prasad, Ram Vilas Paswan and Jitan Ram Manjhi with the legendary clash between Nitish Kumar and Narendra Modi &#8211; with the untold version on the 2010 dinner cancellation and Nitish?s ambition, providing the third angle. Right from revealing JP?s dilemma between Lalu and Nitish to socialist leader Karpoori Thakur out-thinking the Congress with his simplicity. From Jagannath Mishra making a confession on his controversial 1982 Anti-Press Bill to the numerous tales of vernaculariszation of politics and giving a voice to the poor by Lalu, the writer also traces the story of the making of the Ranbir Sena at the height of caste wars.

Alfonso de Trast?mara ha muerto en sospechosas circunstancias y Enrique IV se alza como rey obligando a su hermanastra Isabel, la ?nica que podr?a oponerse a sus planes, a firmar la paz. Ella acepta, pues est? destinada a convertirse en Isabel la Cat?lica y sabe que las grandes partidas no se ganan en el primer movimiento.Mientras los asuntos de la Corte mantienen al reino en vilo, el misterioso asesinato de un noble une fortuitamente a Gadea, una joven apasionada del ajedrez que esconde un oscuro pasado, y a Ruy, un cronista amante de la Historia y los libros. La peligrosa carrera a contrarreloj de ambos para descubrir al culpable se entrelaza con las conspiraciones y las guerras de la Corte de Isabel, quien bajo su mandato supo moverse como una maestra en el tablero y transform? para siempre la figura de la reina en el ajedrez.</p>

<p>Summary : &#8220;MULTICULTURAL LAW ENFORCEMENT: STRATEGIES FOR PEACEKEEPING IN A DIVERSE SOCIETY, 5/e&#8221;explains how the influences of culture, race, and ethnicity impact law enforcement and the communities they serve. Known for its breadth of coverage, this classic text addresses a variety of populations and includes new material on the mentally ill, the homeless, gangs, immigrants, Native Americans, multiracial groups, and cross-cultural communications styles. Using cases, guidelines, and protocols, it focuses on the contact police officers and civilian employees have with the community and stresses the importance of cultural awareness, understanding and respect.</p>

<p>Summary : In author Sarah Price&#8217;s fresh and inspirational retelling of a beloved classic, a dutiful young Amish woman agrees to marry a notorious recluse for her family&#8217;s sake&#8211;but the consequences are more than either bargained for . . . To most townsfolk, he&#8217;s known simply as The Beast. Annabelle Beiler has little interest in gossip, but she&#8217;s heard about Adam Herschberger&#8217;s scars and his gruff, solitary ways. Though he sounds like a character from one of Belle&#8217;s treasured books, the man is real and, it turns out, just as unreasonable as the rumors claim. When a buggy accident wipes out the last of her daed&#8217;s money, forcing him to sell their farm, Adam buys it. Then he offers Belle a deal&#8211;marry him, and her family can keep their home. Everyone is shocked by Belle&#8217;s decision, but she&#8217;s determined to be a good fraa, cleaning Adam&#8217;s rundown house and tending the overgrown garden. Breaking through her new husband&#8217;s icy reserve will be another matter. Belle&#8217;s courage and strength are abundant, </p>

Would that it were! Almost every psychologist or counselor with whom I have talked knows of several instances in which it has happened.

<p>Summary : Listening Length: 9 hours and 5 minutes Wanted: One roommate to share a 3-bedroom house, split the rent, and ideally not be the guy I can?t stop thinking about. I?m a man with too many secrets, so the last thing I need is a new roommate with a sexy smile and blue eyes that see right through me. Eight years ago, Roderick left town after high school. We?re not friends. I owe him nothing. But back then, I let one of my secrets slip, and he?s the only one who noticed. Part of me knows I should run far, far away. But the other part wants him to come upstairs and spend the night. But if I let him in, I could lose everything.  Seeking: A room to rent in town. I?m tidy, have no pets, and I will feed you homemade bread. I should probably add: gay AF, and has no filter. It?s no wonder my new landlord is so wary of me. A smarter man would ignore those hot glances from the broody lumberjack. He may want more from me than another fresh-baked pretzel. But if I push my luck, I?ll end up back on the </p>

<p>Summary : We&#8217;re facing an information overload.With the quick tap of a finger we can access an endless stream of addictive information?sports scores, breaking news, political opinions, streaming TV, the latest Instagram posts, and much more. Accessing information has never been easier?but acquiring wisdom is increasingly difficult.In an effort to help us consume a more balanced, healthy diet of information, Brett McCracken has created the ?Wisdom Pyramid.? Inspired by the food pyramid model, the Wisdom Pyramid challenges us to increase our intake of enduring, trustworthy sources (like the Bible) while moderating our consumption of less reliable sources (like the Internet and social media). At a time when so much of our daily media diet is toxic and making us spiritually sick, The Wisdom Pyramid suggests that we become healthy and wise when we reorient our lives around God?the foundation of truth and the eternal source of wisdom.</p>

<p>Summary : True or false? In selling high-value products or services: closing increases your chance of success; it is essential to describe the benefits of your product or service to the customer; objection handling is an important skill; and open questions are more effective than closed questions. All false, says Neil Rackham. He and his team studied more than 35,000 sales calls made by 10,000 sales people in 23 countries over 12 years. Their findings revealed that many of the methods developed for selling low-value goods just don&#8217;t work for major sales. Rackham went on to introduce his SPIN-selling method, where SPIN describes the whole selling process &#8211; Situation questions, Problem questions, Implication questions, Need-payoff questions.</p>

<p>Summary : Four elite fae warriors. One mortal female. A magical bond they can&#8217;t allow&#8211;or resist.  Orphaned and sold to a harsh master, Lera&#8217;s life is about mucking stalls, avoiding her master&#8217;s advances, and steering clear of the mystical forest separating the mortal and fae worlds. Only fools venture into the immortal realms, and only dark rumors come out&#8230; Until four powerful fae warriors appear at Lera&#8217;s barn. River, Coal, Tye, and Shade have waited a decade for their new fifth to be chosen, the wounds from their quint brother&#8217;s loss still raw. But the magic has played a cruel trick, bonding the four immortal warriors to&#8230; a female. A mortal female. Distractingly beautiful and dangerously frail, Lera can only be one thing&#8211;a mistake. Yet as the males bring Lera back to the fae lands to sever the bond, they discover that she holds more power over their souls than is safe for anyone&#8230; especially for Lera herself.

<p>Summary : Four elite fae warriors. One mortal female. A magical bond they can&#8217;t allow&#8211;or resist.  Orphaned and sold to a harsh master, Lera&#8217;s life is about mucking stalls, avoiding her master&#8217;s advances, and steering clear of the mystical forest separating the mortal and fae worlds. Only fools venture into the immortal realms, and only dark rumors come out&#8230; Until four powerful fae warriors appear at Lera&#8217;s barn. River, Coal, Tye, and Shade have waited a decade for their new fifth to be chosen, the wounds from their quint brother&#8217;s loss still raw. But the magic has played a cruel trick, bonding the four immortal warriors to&#8230; a female. A mortal female. Distractingly beautiful and dangerously frail, Lera can only be one thing&#8211;a mistake. Yet as the males bring Lera back to the fae lands to sever the bond, they discover that she holds more power over their souls than is safe for anyone&#8230; especially for Lera herself. Power of Five is a full-length reverse-harem fantasy novel. </p>

<p>Summary : For decades, the reigning scholarly wisdom about nuclear weapons policy has been that the United States only needs the ability to absorb an enemy nuclear attack and still be able to respond with a devastating counterattack. So long as the US, or any other nation, retains such an assured retaliation capability, no sane leader would intentionally launch a nuclear attack against it, and nuclear deterrence will hold. According to this theory, possessing more weapons than necessary for a second-strike capability is illogical.This argument is reasonable, but, when compared to the empirical record, it raises an important puzzle. Empirically, we see that the United States has always maintained a nuclear posture that is much more robust than a mere second-strike capability. In The Logic of American Nuclear Strategy, Matthew Kroenig challenges the conventional wisdom and explains why a robust nuclear posture, above and beyond a mere second-strike capability, contributes to a state&#8217;s national </p>

<p>Summary : I thought he was the one. I thought we were headed someplace great. I didn&#8217;t know anything. My mystery man is no longer such a mystery. He&#8217;s still commanding and headstrong, playing my body and mind like an instrument, but I&#8217;m finding there are layers to him I never could have dreamed. What I&#8217;ve learned since that fateful night in his apartment has me reeling. Now, though, the truth has taken a backstage to other, more pressing matters. While I struggle to make a choice that will determine the direction of my future, lies that I thought had been carefully hidden away are coming to light. My head is such a mess I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s up or down anymore. Will I be able to sort it all out, or will the life I&#8217;ve worked so hard to build come crashing down in a pile of secrets and lies?</p>

Will I be able to sort it all out, or will the life I&#8217;ve worked so hard to build come crashing down in a pile of secrets and lies?</p>

<p>Summary : Spanning 23,000 miles, the Tropic of Capricorn marks the southernmost border of the tropics and is a place of both amazing beauty and overwhelming human suffering. Starting in Africa and heading east through Australia and South America, Simon Reeve conducts a mammoth expedition along the entire length of the tropic in this thrilling account. Along the way he encounters breathtaking landscapes and truly extraordinary people, from Bushmen of the Kalahari and Namibian prostitutes battling with HIV to gem miners in Madagascar and teenagers in the Brazilian favela once described as the most dangerous place on earth. Collected here are the most daring adventures, the strangest rituals, and the most exotic wildlife in the world, all linked together by one invisible line.</p>

  The Glorified Babysitter. <br />
Zeus has finally decreed that the gods may leave Olympus and mingle &#8211; anonymously &#8211; with the mortals of the present. With zero warning or waiting for him to consent to this arrangement, Hades is placed in charge of not only helping the gods assimilate but also financing them. Unlike the other gods, Hades never withdrew from the mortal world. Instead he spent six months of every year among them, building a fortune befitting one of his many names. As long as the gods follow his strict rules for living among mortals, they have access to a generous monthly stipend. Break the rules, lose the privileges. No allowances. Ever.Goddess of Spring.

Zeus has finally decreed that the gods may leave Olympus and mingle &amp;#8211; anonymously &amp;#8211; with the mortals of the present. With zero warning or waiting for him to consent to this arrangement, Hades is placed in charge of not only helping the gods assimilate but also financing them. Unlike the other gods, Hades never withdrew from the mortal world. Instead he spent six months of every year among them, building a fortune befitting one of his many names. As long as the gods follow his strict rules for living among mortals, they have access to a generous monthly stipend. Break the rules, lose the privileges. No allowances. Ever.Goddess of Spring. The Maiden. The Mistress. The Venerable One&amp;#8230; The Social Media Manager. For the last two years, Persephone has lived among the mortals, enjoying everything the world she was so sheltered from has to offer.

<p>Summary : <br />
  A witty, informative guide to writing &#8220;good English&#8221; from Random House&#8217;s longtime copy chief and one of Twitter&#8217;s leading enforcers of proper grammar&#8211;a twenty-first-century </p>
<p>    Elements of Style</p>
<p>As authoritative as it is amusing, this book distills everything Benjamin Dreyer has learned from the hundreds of books he has copyedited, including works by Elizabeth Strout, E. L. Doctorow, and Frank Rich, into a useful guide not just for writers but for everyone who wants to put their best foot forward in writing prose. Dreyer offers lessons on the ins and outs of punctuation and grammar, including how to navigate the words he calls &#8220;the confusables,&#8221; like tricky homophones; the myriad ways to use (and misuse) a comma; and how to recognize&#8211;though not necessarily do away with&#8211;the passive voice. (Hint: If you can plausibly add &#8220;by zombies&#8221; to the end of a sentence, it&#8217;s passive.)

<p>Summary : Considered by many to be the iconic French memoirist?s defining work and a breakout bestseller when published in France in 2008.The Years is a personal narrative of the period 1941 to 2006 told through the lens of memory, impressions past and present?even projections into the future?photos, books, songs, radio, television and decades of advertising, headlines, contrasted with intimate conflicts and writing notes from 6 decades of diaries.Local dialect, words of the times, slogans, brands and names for the ever-proliferating objects, are given voice here. The voice we recognize as the author?s continually dissolves and re-emerges. Ernaux makes the passage of time palpable. Time itself, inexorable, narrates its own course, consigning all other narrators to anonymity.

<p>Summary : Outstanding new fiction from the Miles Franklin-shortlisted author of BloodIn this breathtaking new work, Tony Birch affirms his position as one of Australia?s finest writers of short-form fiction.Using his unflinching creative gaze, he ponders love and loss and faith. A trio of amateur thieves are left in charge of a baby moments before a heist. A group of boys compete in the final of a marbles tournament, only to find their biggest challenge was the opponent they didn?t see coming. Two young friends find a submerged car in their local swimming hole and become obsessed by the mystery of the driver?s identity. Across twelve blistering stories, The Promise delivers a sensitive and often humorous take on the lives of those who have loved, lost and wandered.</p>

<p>Summary : Instrumental Analysis provides a rigorous, modern, and engaging coverage of chemical instrumentation, written with the undergraduate student in mind. At its core, Instrumental Analysis includes the underlying theory, instrumental design, applications and operation of spectroscopic, electroanalytical, chromatographic, and mass spectral instrumentation. It provides students with the requisite skills to identify the comparative advantages and disadvantages in choosing one analytical technique over another by combining direct comparisons of the techniques with a discussion of how these choices affect the interpretation of the data in its final form.</p>

<p>Summary : Haunted by memories of the Great War, failed academic Frank Nichols and his wife have arrived in the sleepy Georgia town of Whitbrow, where Frank hopes to write a history of his family?s old estate?the Savoyard Plantation?and the horrors that occurred there.

Where a long-smoldering debt of blood has never been forgotten.Where it has been waiting for Frank Nichols?</p>

<p>Summary : The Western world has turned its back on migrants, leaving them to cope with one of the most devastating humanitarian crises in history.In 2018, Sally Hayden received a message on Facebook: ?Hi sister Sally, we need your help.? It was from an Eritrean refugee who had been held in a Libyan detention center for months, locked in one big hall with scant meals. Now, Tripoli was crumbling in a scrimmage between warring factions, and the refugees remained stuck, defenseless, with only one hope: contacting her. With that begins Hayden?s staggering account of the migrant crisis across North Africa: from brutal, vindictive Libyan guards to unexpected acts of kindness; the frustration of visiting aid workers; fake marriages between detainees; the strain on real marriages; and the phenomenon of some refugees becoming oppressors after entering into Faustian bargains with their captors.

<p>Summary : Sebastian Vettel ? uno sportivo, un pilota che, fra il 2010 e il 2013, ha vinto quattro titoli mondiali consecutivi in Formula 1. In settant&#8217;anni di vita della categoria, sono solo quattro i campioni che possono dire di averlo fatto: Juan-Manuel Fangio, Michael Schumacher, Lewis Hamilton e lui. Dopo questo poker, Vettel ha guidato la Ferrari per sei stagioni, con l&#8217;ovvio obiettivo di vincere ancora. Obiettivo fallito, da lui e dalla squadra, per tante ragioni: la cui analisi occupa buona parte di quest&#8217;opera. Chi ? dunque Sebastian Vettel: un pilota sopravvalutato, che vinceva solo in condizioni di superiorit? tecnica; o un campione a tutto tondo, a cui non sono sempre state date le armi giuste per ogni battaglia? Discussioni di questo tipo occupano gi? i forum e le piattaforme social: lasciamole l?, il loro posto ? quello. L&#8217;autore ha conosciuto Sebastian al suo debutto in F1. Da giornalista si ? occupato di lui per anni, prima di averlo come compagno di lavoro per quattro stagioni, </p>

<p>Summary : Sebastian Vettel ? uno sportivo, un pilota che, fra il 2010 e il 2013, ha vinto quattro titoli mondiali consecutivi in Formula 1. In settant&#8217;anni di vita della categoria, sono solo quattro i campioni che possono dire di averlo fatto: Juan-Manuel Fangio, Michael Schumacher, Lewis Hamilton e lui. Dopo questo poker, Vettel ha guidato la Ferrari per sei stagioni, con l&#8217;ovvio obiettivo di vincere ancora.

<p>Summary : Nasubukan mo na bang magmahal ng isang taong alam mong hindi ka mamahalin? Naranasan mo na bang maging sobrang malapit sa taong yun pero hindi mo pa rin magawang hawakan ang puso niya? Matagal nang tinanggap ni AMBER LOPEZ na pagdating sa larangan ng pag-Ibig, malas siya. Madalas kasi siyang mapagtripan ng tadhana. Nang bumalik siya sa London matapos niyang pakawalan ang ex niyang si JIRO at tanggapin na masaya na ito sa ibang babae, bun na ang boob niya na mag-move on at kalimutan ang nakaraan. Ngunit hindi inakala ni Amber na magtatagpo ang landas nila ng kaibigan ng kanyang ex-boyfriend na si REN SALVADOR. Dahil madalas magkasama ang dalawa, nagawang makapag-move on ni Amber kay Jiro kaya lang unti-unti na siyang nahuhulog kay Ren. Ang kaso, hindi pa rin magawang makapag-move on ni Ren sa past love niyang si ARCIE na ngayon ay girlfriend na ng ex ni Amber na si Jiro. At habang tumatagal, nare-realize ni Amber na ang pinakamahirap pala talagang kakumpitensya sa larangan ng pag-ibig </p>

<p>Summary : By the author of Foreskin&#8217;s Lament, a novel of identity, tribalism, and mothers.Seventh Seltzer has done everything he can to break from the past, but in his overbearing, narcissistic mother&#8217;s last moments he is drawn back into the life he left behind. At her deathbed, she whispers in his ear the two words he always knew she would: &#8220;Eat me.&#8221;This is not unusual, as the Seltzers are Cannibal-Americans, a once proud and thriving ethnic group, but for Seventh, it raises some serious questions, both practical and emotional. Of practical concern, his dead mother is six-foot-two and weighs about four hundred and fifty pounds. Even divided up between Seventh and his eleven brothers, that&#8217;s a lot of red meat. Plus Second keeps kosher, Ninth is vegan, First hated her, and Sixth is dead. To make matters worse, even if he can wrangle his brothers together for a feast, the Can-Am people have assimilated, and the only living Cannibal who knows how to perform the ancient ritual is their Uncle </p>

<p>Summary : EZRAPartying, dudes, and hockey. What more could a gay NHL player want?If it weren&#8217;t for Anton Hayes, my life would be perfect.Not that he affects my life in any way. At all. That would imply I care what the winger from Philly thinks of me.Which I don&#8217;t.Not even a one-night stand with him can thaw his misplaced animosity toward me.He says I&#8217;m the one with the ego, but he can talk. He rivals me for most egotistical puck boy in the league.I hate him as much as he hates me. Even if I crave a repeat.ANTONWhen it comes to hockey, I&#8217;m all about the game.I&#8217;ve worked for years to be one of the best in the league, and l&#8217;ve done it without splashing my orientation all over the tabloids.My hockey image is one I&#8217;ve carefully cultivated, and after one night with Ezra Palaszczuk, I risk it all.He&#8217;s cocky, obnoxious, and has an ego bigger than Massachusetts. And okay, maybe he&#8217;s the sexiest man I&#8217;ve ever known.We&#8217;ll never get along. Not when we sleep together. Not even when my possessive streak </p>

<p>Summary : Lower Manhattan: A sniper&#8217;s bullet ends the life of a high-profile New Yorker. Five miles uptown, a second prominent victim has his throat slashed. And that&#8217;s only the beginning. A network of professional assassins is on the loose in New York City. Trained by the US military, they&#8217;re on their own now, with a new unit called Kappa Omega Delta. Killers On Demand. NYPD Red detectives Kylie MacDonald and Zach Jordan are called in to hunt them down, but these mercenaries are as gifted in the art of escape as they are in snuffing out lives. It&#8217;s the biggest professional challenge the Red team has ever faced, and before it&#8217;s over, both Kylie&#8217;s and Zach&#8217;s personal lives will change. Forever.</p>

<p>Summary : ?Il concetto di diritto? ? un&#8217;opera di filosofia del diritto nel senso classico della parola. Il diritto ?, per Hart, un insieme di norme come la morale e si serve della forza; ma non ?, come sostiene una dottrina tradizionale, un insieme di norme sostenute dalla forza. ? invece una forma specifica di ordinamento di norme secondarie che attribuiscono poteri. Tra i diversi contrasti dottrinari Hart trova la propria strada, che ? quella del positivista intransigente ma moderato e del normativista coerente ma non esasperato. Questa edizione si arricchisce di un Poscritto dell&#8217;autore e dui una Nota dei curatori.</p>

<p>Summary : This ?fun, brain-twisting book . . . will make you think? as it explores more than 75 paradoxes in mathematics, philosophy, physics, and the social sciences (Sean Carroll, New York Times ?bestselling author of Something Deeply Hidden ).Paradox is a sophisticated kind of magic trick.

In Sleight of Mind , Matt Cook and a few collaborators dive deeply into more than 75 paradoxes in mathematics, physics, philosophy, and the social sciences.
